The O
prevailing O
interpretation O

nomination O
of O
said O
person O
. O
'' O

Thus O
, O
with O
one O
brief O
passage O
in O
an O
appropriations O
bill O
, O
Congress S-ORG
repeals O
the O
president O
's O
power O
to O
make O
recess O
appointments O
under O
Article B-LAW
II E-LAW
. O

Section B-LAW
605 E-LAW
also O
imposes O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
on O
the O
president O
's O
ability O
to O
nominate O
candidates O
of O
his O
choosing O
. O

The O
language O
of O
the O
appropriations O
rider O
implies O
that O
any O
nomination O
to O
any O
position O
of O
a O
rejected O
nominee O
will O
result O
in O
the O
president O
being O
denied O
funding O
to O
pay O
that O
person O
's O
salary O
. O

The O
president O
could O
probably O
not O
avoid O
this O
restriction O
by O
choosing O
people O
willing O
to O
serve O
without O
pay O
, O
because O
the B-LAW
Anti-Deficiency I-LAW
Act E-LAW
prohibits O
voluntary O
service O
to O
the O
government O
. O

The O
1990 S-DATE
appropriations O
bills O
also O
contain O
a O
number O
of O
`` O
muzzling O
'' O
provisions O
that O
violate O
the O
recommendation O
clause O
in O
Article B-LAW
II I-LAW
of I-LAW
the I-LAW
Constitution E-LAW
. O

Muzzling O
provisions O
, O
which O
might O
be O
called O
`` O
blindfold O
laws O
'' O
as O
well O
, O
prevent O
the O
executive O
branch O
from O
even O
looking O
at O
certain O
policy O
options O
, O
let O
alone O
from O
recommending O
them O
to O
Congress S-ORG
. O

Such O
laws O
violate O
the O
provision O
in O
Article B-LAW
II E-LAW
that O
requires O
the O
president O
to O
make O
recommendations O
to O
Congress S-ORG
, O
but O
which O
gives O
the O
president O
the O
discretion O
to O
select O
the O
subject O
matter O
of O
those O
recommendations O
. O

Typically O
, O
these O
laws O
seek O
to O
prevent O
executive O
branch O
officials O
from O
inquiring O
into O
whether O
certain O
federal O
programs O
make O
any O
economic O
sense O
or O
proposing O
more O
market O
- O
oriented O
alternatives O
to O
regulations O
. O

Probably O
the O
most O
egregious O
example O
is O
a O
proviso O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bill O
for O
the O
executive O
office O
that O
prevents O
the O
president O
's O
Office B-ORG
of I-ORG
Management I-ORG
and I-ORG
Budget E-ORG
from O
subjecting O
agricultural O
marketing O
orders O
to O
any O
cost O
- O
benefit O
scrutiny O
. O

There O
is O
something O
inherently O
suspect O
about O
Congress S-ORG
's O
prohibiting O
the O
executive O
from O
even O
studying O
whether O
public O
funds O
are O
being O
wasted O
in O
some O
favored O
program O
or O
other O
. O

Perhaps O
none O
of O
the O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
contained O
in O
the O
appropriations O
bills O
for O
fiscal B-DATE
1990 E-DATE
better O
illustrates O
Congress S-ORG
's O
attempt O
to O
usurp O
executive O
power O
than O
Section B-LAW
609 E-LAW
of O
the O
executive O

bill O
: O
`` O

only O

more O
difficult O
for O

. O

President O
Reagan S-PERSON
learned O
that O
lesson O
. O

By O
1987 S-DATE
, O
then O
- O
Speaker O
Jim B-PERSON
Wright E-PERSON
was O
discussing O
arms O
control O
in O
Moscow S-GPE
with O
Mikhail B-PERSON
Gorbachev E-PERSON
and O
then O
attempting O

direct O
the O

through O
an O
appropriations O
rider O
, O
to O
treat O
the O
Soviets S-NORP
as O
though O
the O
Senate S-ORG
had O
ratified O
SALT B-LAW
II E-LAW
. O

If O
a O
veto O
is O
unworkable O
because O
it O
would O
leave O
part O
of O
the O
executive O
branch O
unfunded O
, O
the O
president O
could O
sign O
the O
appropriations O
bills O
into O
law O
and O
assert O
a O
power O
of O
excision O
, O
declaring O
the O
rider O
restricting O
his O
Article B-LAW
II E-LAW
powers O
to O
be O
unconstitutional O
and O
severable O
. O

The O
Constitution S-LAW
does O
not O
expressly O
give O
the O
president O
such O
power O
. O

However O
, O
the O
president O
does O
have O
a O
duty O
not O
to O
violate O
the O
Constitution S-LAW
. O

The O
question O
is O
whether O
his O
only O
means O
of O
defense O
is O
the O
veto O
. O

Excision O
of O
appropriations O
riders O
that O
trespass O
on O
the O
president O

duties O
and O
prerogative O
under O
Article B-LAW
II E-LAW
would O
be O
different O
from O
the O
line O
- O
item O
veto O
. O

As O
discussed O
in O
the O
context O
of O
controlling O
federal O
spending O
, O
the O
line O
- O
item O
veto O
is O
characterized O
as O
a O
way O
for O
the O
president O
to O
excise O
perfectly O
constitutional O
provisions O
in O
a O
spending O
bill O
that O
are O
objectionable O
merely O
because O
they O
conflict O
with O
his O
policy O
objectives O
. O

The O
excision O
of O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
in O
an O
appropriations O
bill O
would O
be O
a O
power O
of O
far O
more O
limited O
applicability O
. O

One O
could O
argue O
that O
it O
is O
not O
an O
assertion O
of O
a O
item O
veto O
at O
all O
for O
the O
president O
, O
by O
exerting O
a O
power O
of O
excision O
, O
to O
resist O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
in O
legislation O
that O
violate O
the O
separation O
of O
powers O
. O

There O
is O
no O
downside O
if O
the O
president O
asserts O
a O
right O
of O
excision O
over O
unconstitutional O
conditions O
in O
the O
fiscal B-DATE

it O

President O

might O
win O

In O
that O
case O
, O
he O
might O
receive O
an O
opinion O

that O

, O
the O

must O
do O
more O

evaluate O

it O

how O

these O

Why O
do O
local O

overreact O
to O

Because O

In O

we O
learn O
that O
Michelle S-PERSON

has O
indeed O
pulled O

Michelle S-PERSON
blabs O

Little O
chance O
that O
Shane B-ORG

going O

recoup O
today S-DATE

Traders O
spend O

the O
belief O
that O

Ah O
, O

out O
well O

all O

much O
for O

the O
market O
by O
a B-TIME

And O
a O
large O
slice O

devoted O
to O
efforts O

get O
rid O
of O
some O
nearly O

Surprisingly O
, O
Shane B-ORG
Longman E-ORG
survives O
the B-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
only O
to O
have O
a O
senior O
executive O
innocently O
bumble O
his O
way O
into O
becoming O
the O
target O
of O
a O
criminal O
insider O
trading O
investigation O
. O

Instead O
of O
closing O
ranks O
to O
protect O
the O
firm O
's O
reputation O
, O
the O
executive O
's O
internal O
rivals O
, O
led O
by O
a O
loutish O
American S-NORP
, O
demand O
his O
resignation O
. O

The O
plot O
is O
thwarted O
when O
the O
firm O
's O
major O
stockholder O
, O
kelp O
farming O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
the O
globe O
, O
hurries O
home O
to O
support O
the O
executive O
. O

But O
the O
investigation O
continues O
. O

If O
you O
can O
swallow O
the O
premise O
that O
the O
rewards O
for O
such O
ineptitude O
are O
six S-CARDINAL
- O
figure O

, O
you O
still O
are O
left O
puzzled O
, O
because O
few O
of O
the O
yuppies O
consume O
very O
conspicuously O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
few O
consume O
much O
of O
anything O

Two S-CARDINAL

a O
house O
almost O
devoid O
of O

Michelle S-PERSON
lives O
in O
a O

and O
although O
she O
drives O
a O
canary O

colored O

she O
has O
n't O
time O

the O

up O

can O
be O

because O
the O

broken O
off O

And O
it O
takes O
Declan S-PERSON
, O
the O
obligatory O
ladies O
' O
man O
of O
the O
cast O
, O
until O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
episode O
to O
get O
past O
first S-ORDINAL
base O
with O
any O
of O
his O
prey O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
explanation O
for O
these O
anomalies O
is O
that O
class O
- O
conscious O
Britain S-GPE
is O
n't O
ready O
to O
come O
to O
terms O
with O
the O
wealth O
created O
by O
the O
Thatcherian O
free O

enterprise O
regime O
. O

After O
all O
, O
this O
is O
n't O
old O
money O
, O
but O
new O
money O
, O
and O
in O
many O
cases O
, O
young O
money O

This O
attitude O
is O
clearly O
illustrated O
in O
the O
treatment O
of O
Max S-PERSON
, O
the O

most O
flamboyant O

Yuppily O

lavishly O

drives O
an O
antique O

. O

But O
apparently O
to O
make O
him O
palatable O
, O
even O
lovable O
, O
to O
the O
masses O
, O
the O
script O
inflates O
pony O

Max S-PERSON
into O
an O
eccentric O
genius O
, O
master O
of O
11 S-CARDINAL
Chinese S-NORP

He O
takes O
his O

to O
the O

where O
he O
meets O
a O
punky O
French S-NORP
girl O
who O
dupes O
him O
into O
providing O
a O

for O
her O

and O
then O
promptly O
steals O
his O

not O
as O
an O

Rather O
, O
it O

Why O
does O

Perhaps O
it O
is O
because O
utopian O

A B-DATE

Those O

suspect O
today S-DATE
that O
an O

despite O
their O
protests O
that O

no O

Choice O
of O
the O
volunteer O

in O
the B-DATE
1970s E-DATE
seemed O
to O
doom O
national O
service O
as O
much O
as O
the O
draft O
. O

But O
the O
virus O
was O
kept O
alive O
in O
sociology O

until O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE

when O
it O
again O
was O
let O

This O

it O
attempted O
to O
invade O
two S-CARDINAL

problems O

the O
rising O

higher O

the O
rising O
expense O
to O
the O
federal O

grants O

Why O
not O
keep O
and O
even O
expand O
the O
loans O

grants O
, O
the O
advocates O
reasoned O

but O
require O
some O

Military O

, O
moreover O
, O
could O
be O
a O

Thus O
, O
undoubtedly O
it O
was O

prove O

It O
is O
widely O
known O
that O
`` O
too O
many O
cooks O
spoil O
the O
broth O
, O
'' O
but O
that O
wisdom O
does O
not O
necessarily O
reflect O
the O
view O
of O
the O
cooks O
, O
especially O
if O
they O
are O
senators O
. O

The O
`` O
omnibus O
'' O
bill O
coming O
out O
of O
Congress S-ORG
may O
be O
unwholesome O
glop O
, O
but O
the O
assorted O
chefs O
are O
happy O
and O
the O
restaurant O
is O
pushing O
the O
dish O
very O
hard O
. O

The O
aroma O
of O
patronage O
is O
in O
the O
air O
. O

Is O
the O
voluntary O
sector O
so O
weak O
that O
it O
needs O
such O
unsolicited O
assistance O
? O

On O
the O
contrary O
, O
it O
is O
as O
robust O
as O
ever O
. O

According O
to O
the B-ORG
Gallup I-ORG
Poll E-ORG
, O
American S-NORP
adults O
contribute O
an O
average O
of O
two B-TIME
hours E-TIME
a O
week O
of O
service O
, O
while O
financial O

1980s E-DATE
have O
risen O
30 B-PERCENT
% E-PERCENT
-LRB- O

-RRB- O
. O

Even O
if O
government O
does O
see O
various O
`` O
unmet O
needs O
, O
'' O
national O
service O
is O
not O
the O
way O
to O
meet O
them O
. O

If O
we O
want O
to O
support O
students O
, O
we O
might O
adopt O
the O
idea O
used O
in O
other O
countries O
of O
offering O
more O
scholarships O
based O
on O
something O
called O
`` O
scholarship O
, O
'' O
rather O
than O
on O
the O
government O
's O
idea O
of O
`` O
service O
. O
'' O

Or O
we O
might O
provide O
a O
tax O
credit O
for O
working O
students O
. O

What O
we O
do O
not O
need O
to O
do O
is O
start O
a O
war O
, O
and O
then O
try O
to O
justify O
it O
by O
creating O
a B-LAW
GI I-LAW
Bill E-LAW
. O

To O
the O
extent O
we O
lack O
manpower O
to O
staff O
menial O
jobs O
in O
hospitals O
, O
for O
example O
, O
we O
should O
raise O
pay O
, O
pursue O
labor O
- O
saving O
technology O
, O
or O
allow O
more O
legal O
immigration O
, O
rather O
than O
overpay O
high O
school O
graduates O
as O
short O
- O
term O
workers O
and O
cause O
resentment O
among O
permanent O
workers O
paid O
lesser O
amounts O
to O
do O
the O
same O
jobs O
. O

Will O
national O
service O
, O
in O
the O
current O
highly O
politicized O
and O
opportunistic O
form O
exert O
enough O
appeal O
to O
get O
adopted O
? O

Not O
necessarily O
. O

Polls O
show O
wide O
, O
generalized O
support O
for O
some O
vague O
concept O
of O
service O
, O
but O
the O
bill O
now O
under O
discussion O
lacks O
any O
passionate O
public O
backing O
. O

Nonetheless O
, O
Senate S-ORG
Democrats S-NORP
are O
organizing O
a O
roll O
of O
supporting O
`` O
associations O
, O
'' O
`` O
societies O
'' O
and O
`` O

, O
'' O
some O
of O
which O
may O
hope O
to O
receive O
the O
paid O
`` O

. O
'' O

So O
far O
, O
the O
president O
seems O
ill O
- O
disposed O
to O
substitute O
any O
of O
the O
omnibus O
for O
his O
own O
free O

proposal O
to O

of O
all O

and O
exhort O
them O
to O

. O

However O
, O
even O
this O
admirable O
plan O
could O
become O
objectionable O
if O
the B-ORG
White I-ORG
House E-ORG
gives O
in O
to O
congressional O
Democratic S-NORP
pressure O
to O
add O

the O

or O
to O
involve O
the O
independent O
foundation O
in O
`` O

'' O
federal O
funds O
for O
volunteer O
projects O
. O

There O
's O
no O
need O
for O
such O
concessions O
. O

The O
omnibus O
can O
be O
defeated O
, O
the O

Friday S-DATE
's O
190 S-CARDINAL
- O
point O
plunge O
in O
stocks O
does O
not O
come O
atop O
the O
climate O
of O
anxiety O
that O
dominated O
financial O
markets O
just O
prior O
to O
their O
1987 B-DATE
October E-DATE
crash O
, O
and O
mechanisms O
have O
been O
put O
in O
place O
to O
keep O
markets O
more O
orderly O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
lesson O
is O
about O
the O
same O
: O
On O
Friday B-DATE
the I-DATE
13th E-DATE
, O
the O
market O
was O
spooked O
by O
Washington S-GPE
. O

The O
consensus O
along O
the O
street O
seems O
to O
be O
that O
the O
plunge O
was O
triggered O
by O
the O
financing O
problems O
of O
the O
UAL S-ORG
takeover O
, O
and O
it O
's O
certainly O
true O
the O
rout O
began O
immediately O
after O
the O
UAL S-ORG
trading O
halt O
. O

Still O
, O
the O
consensus O
seems O
almost O
as O
wide O
that O
one S-CARDINAL
faltering O
bid O
is O
no O
reason O
to O
write O
down O
the O
value O
of O
all O
U.S. S-GPE
business O
. O

This O
observation O
leads O
us O
to O
another O
piece O
of O
news O
moving O
on O
the O
Dow B-ORG
Jones E-ORG
ticker O
shortly O
before O
the O
downturn O
: O
the O
success O
of O
Senate S-ORG
Democrats S-NORP
in O
stalling O
the O
capital O
gains O
tax O
cut O
. O

The O
real O
value O
of O
all O
shares O
, O
after O
all O
, O
is O
directly O
impacted O
by O
the O
tax O
on O
any O
profits O
-LRB- O
all O
the O
more O
so O
given O
the O
limits O
on O
deductions O
for O
losses O
that O
show O
gains O
are O
not O
`` O
ordinary O
income O
'' O
-RRB- O
. O

And O
market O
expectations O
clearly O
have O
been O
raised O
by O
the O
capital O
gains O
victory O
in O
the O
House S-ORG
last B-DATE
month E-DATE
. O

An B-TIME
hour E-TIME
before O
Friday S-DATE
's O
plunge O
, O
that O
provision O
was O
stripped O
from O
the O
tax O
bill O
, O
leaving O
it O
with O
$ B-MONEY
5.4 I-MONEY
billion E-MONEY
in O
tax O
increases O
without O
a O
capital O
gains O
cut O
. O

There O
is O
a O
great O
deal O
to O
be O
said O
, O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
for O
stripping O
the O
garbage O
out O
of O
the O
reconciliation O
bill O
. O

It O
would O
be O
a O
good O
thing O
if O
Congress S-ORG
started O
to O
decide O
issues O
one O
- O
by O
- O
one S-CARDINAL
on O
their O
individual O
merits O
without O
trickery O
. O

For O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
, O
no O
one O
doubts O
that O
the O
capital O
gains O
cut O
would O
pass O
on O
an O
up O
- O
or O
- O
down O
vote O
. O

Since O
Senate S-ORG
leaders O
have O
so O
far O
fogged O
it O
up O
with O
procedural O
smokescreens O
, O
promises O
of O
a O
cleaner O
bill O
are O
suspect O
. O

Especially O
so O
since O
President O
Bush S-PERSON
has O
been O
weakened O
by O
the O
Panama S-GPE
fiasco O
. O

To O
the O
extent O
that O
the O
UAL S-ORG
troubles O
contributed O
to O
the O
plunge O
, O
they O
are O
another O
instance O
of O
Washington S-GPE
's O
sticky O
fingers O
. O

As O
the O
best O
opportunities O
for O
corporate O
restructurings O
are O
exhausted O
of O
course O
, O
at O
some O
point O
the O
market O
will O
start O
to O
reject O
them O
. O

But O
the O
airlines O
are O
scarcely O
a O
clear O
case O
, O
given O
anti-takeover O
mischief O
by O
Secretary O
of O
Transportation S-ORG
Skinner S-PERSON
, O
who O
professes O
to O
believe O
safety O
will O
be O
compromised O
if O
KLM S-ORG
and O
British B-ORG
Airways E-ORG
own O
interests O
in O
companies O
that O
fly O
airplanes O
. O

Worse O
, O
Congress S-ORG
has O
started O
to O
jump O
on O
the O
Skinner S-PERSON
bandwagon O
. O

James B-PERSON
Oberstar E-PERSON
, O
the O
Minnesota S-GPE
Democrat S-NORP
who O
chairs O
the O
Public B-ORG
Works I-ORG
and I-ORG
Transportation I-ORG
Committee I-ORG
's E-ORG
aviation O
subcommittee O
, O
has O
put O
an O
anti-airline O
takeover O
bill O
on O
supersonic O
speed O
so O
that O
it O
would O
be O
passed O
in O
time O
to O
affect O
the O
American S-ORG
and O
United B-ORG
Air I-ORG
Lines E-ORG
bids O
. O

It O
would O
give O
Mr. O
Skinner S-PERSON
up B-DATE
to I-DATE
50 I-DATE
days E-DATE
to O
`` O
review O
'' O
any O
bid O
for O
15 B-PERCENT
% E-PERCENT
or O
more O
of O
the O

stock O
of O
any O
U.S. S-GPE
carrier O
with O
revenues O
of O
$ B-MONEY
1 I-MONEY
billion E-MONEY
or O
more O
. O

So O
the O
UAL S-ORG
deal O
has O
problems O
, O
and O
the O
market O
loses O
190 S-CARDINAL
points O
. O

Congratulations O

In O
the O

a O
Danny B-PERSON
Rostenkowski E-PERSON
proposal O
to O
tax O
takeovers O
out O
of O
existance O
. O

Even O
more O
important O
, O
in O
our O

, O
was O
the O
Treasury S-ORG

threat O
to O

the O

. O

The O
Treasury S-ORG
is O
doing O
the O

thankfully O
, O
the O

is O
not O
under O
1987 S-DATE

Also O
, O
traders O
are O
in O
better O
shape O
today S-DATE
than O
in O
1987 S-DATE
to O
survive O
selling O
binges O
. O

They O
are O
better O
capitalized O
. O

They O
are O
in O
less O
danger O
of O
losing O
liquidity O
simply O
because O
of O

lags O

prove O
to O
be O
a O
good O
idea O

In O
any O
event O
, O
some O

see O
stocks O
as O
underpriced O
today S-DATE
, O
unlike O
1987 S-DATE
. O

There O
is O
nothing O
wrong O
with O
the O

that O
ca O
n't O
be O
cured O
by O
a O
little O
coherence O

in O

But O
on O
the O
bearish O
side O
, O
that O
may O
be O
too O
much O
to O

The O
first S-ORDINAL
major O
event O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
in O
U.S. S-GPE
stock O

may O
be O
a O

Under O
a O

the O

in O
the O

five S-CARDINAL

a O
move O
equal O
to O
40 S-CARDINAL
points O
on O
the O

The O
aim O

be O
to O
ease O
the O

which O
would O

That O

is O
just O
one S-CARDINAL

The B-ORG

Mr. O

a O

and O
retired O

mostly O

Hong B-GPE

beginning O
with O
Mickey O

The O

grown O

about B-CARDINAL
40 E-CARDINAL
employees O

from O
four S-CARDINAL

from O
his O

of O
plush O

Like O
many O
others O
, O
Mr. O
Kaye S-PERSON
took O
notice O
in O
1987 S-DATE
when O
Sony S-ORG
, O
in O
a O
classic O
example O
of O
market O
segmentation O
, O
changed O
the O
plastic O
skin O
and O
buttons O
on O
the O
famous O
Walkman S-PRODUCT
line O
of O
portable O
audio O
equipment O
and O
created O
the O
My B-PRODUCT
First I-PRODUCT
Sony E-PRODUCT
line O
for O
children O
. O

The O
brightly O
colored O
new O
products O
looked O
more O
like O
toys O
than O
the O
adult O
models O
. O

-LRB- O
In O
court O
papers O
, O
Sony S-ORG
says O
it O
has O
spent O
more B-MONEY
than I-MONEY
$ I-MONEY
3 I-MONEY
million E-MONEY
to O
promote O
the O
line O
, O
with O
resulting O
sales O
of O
over B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
million E-CARDINAL
units O
. O
-RRB- O

Sony S-ORG
found O
a O
new O
market O
niche O
, O
but O
Mr. O
Kaye S-PERSON
figured O
that O
its O
prices O
left O
plenty O
of O
room O
for O
a O
lower O
- O
priced O
competitor O
. O

His O
products O
are O
n't O
exact O
copies O
of O
Sony S-ORG
's O
but O
strongly O
resemble O
them O
in O
size O
, O
shape O
and O
, O
especially O
, O
color O
. O

Sony S-ORG
uses O
mostly O
red O
and O
blue O
, O
with O
traces O
of O
yellow O
-- O
and O
so O
does O
Justin S-ORG
, O
on O
the O
theory O
that O
kids O
prefer O
these O
colors O
. O

-LRB- O
`` O
To O

and O
Sony S-ORG
noticed O

Indeed O

concerned O
that O

such O
as O

Mr. O

fired O
off O
a O

were O
without O

, O
according O
to O
Mr. O

the O
Sony S-ORG

Recalls O
Mr. O

: O
`` O

In O
addition O

decided O
that O

Pretoria S-GPE

Pretoria S-GPE

for O

In O

the O

Mr. O

in O

Mr. O

was O
a O
mop O

up O
of O
government O
corruption O
, O
purportedly O
at O
all O
levels O
, O
but O
the O
main O
marks O
were O
Mr. O
Papandreou S-PERSON
and O
his O
closest O
associates O
. O

In O
point O
of O
fact O
, O
this O
catharsis O
was O

by O
decades S-DATE
. O

When O
reduced O
to O
buzzword O

in O

, O
the O

transmogrified O

With O

to O
Greece S-GPE

long O

bubbling O

- O

scandal O
, O
Mr. O

Mr. O
Koskotas S-PERSON

credibility O
is O
, O
at O
best O
, O
problematic O
. O

He O
has O
ample O
motive O
to O
shift O
the O
blame O
, O
and O
his O
testimony O
has O
also O
been O
found O
less O
than O
forthright O
on O
numerous O
points O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
New B-ORG
Democracy E-ORG
and O
Communist S-NORP
parties O
herald O
his O
assertions O
as O
proof O
of O
PASOK S-ORG
complicity O
. O

Among O
unanswered O
questions O
are O
whether O
Mr. O
Papandreou S-PERSON
received O
$ B-MONEY
23 I-MONEY
million E-MONEY
of O
stolen O
Bank B-ORG
of I-ORG
Crete E-ORG
funds O
and O
an O
additional O
$ O
734,000 S-MONEY
in O

, O
as O
contended O

whether O
the O
prime O

ordered O
state O
agencies O
to O
deposit O
some O
$ B-MONEY
57 I-MONEY
million E-MONEY
in O
Mr. O
Koskotas S-PERSON

bank O
and O
then O
skim O
off O
the O
interest O
; O
and O
, O
what O
PASOK S-ORG
's O
cut O
was O
from O
the O
$ B-MONEY
210 I-MONEY
million E-MONEY
Mr. O
Koskotas S-PERSON
pinched O
. O

Two S-CARDINAL
former O
ministers O
were O
so O
heavily O
implicated O
in O
the O
Koskotas S-PERSON
affair O
that O
PASOK S-ORG
members O
of O
Parliament S-ORG
voted O
to O
refer O
them O
to O
the O
special O
court O
. O

But O
eluding O
parliamentary O
probe O
was O
the O
case O
of O
millions B-MONEY
of I-MONEY
drachmas E-MONEY
Mr. O
Koskotas S-PERSON
funneled O
into O
New B-ORG
Democracy E-ORG
coffers O
. O

In O
the O
end O
, O
the O
investigation O
produced O
only O
circumstantial O
evidence O
and O
`` O
indications O
'' O
that O
point O
to O
PASOK S-ORG
, O
not O
clinching O
proof O
. O

On O
another O
issue O
, O
Greeks S-NORP
were O
told O
how O
their O
national O
intelligence O
agency O
, O
the O
EYP S-ORG
, O
regularly O
monitored O
the O
telephone O
conversations O
of O
prominent O
figures O
, O
including O
key O
opposition O
politicians O
, O
journalists O
and O
PASOK S-ORG
cabinet O
members O
. O

Despite O
convincing O
arguments O
, O
it O
was O
never O
established O
that O
Mr. O
Papandreou S-PERSON
personally O
ordered O
or O
directed O
the O
wiretaps O
. O

The O
central O
weakness O
of O
the O
`` O
scandals O
'' O
debates O
was O
pointed O
up O
especially O
well O
when O
discussions O
focused O
on O
arms O
deals O
and O
kickbacks O
. O

The O
coalition O
government O
tried O
to O
show O
that O
PASOK S-ORG
ministers O
had O
received O
hefty O
sums O
for O
OKing O
the O
purchase O
of O

and O
France S-GPE

Avions B-ORG
Marcel I-ORG
Dassault E-ORG
, O
respectively O
. O

Naturally O
, O
neither O
General B-ORG
Dynamics E-ORG
nor O
Dassault S-ORG
could O
be O
expected O
to O
hamper O
its O
prospective O
future O

by O
making O

of O
sums O
paid O
-LRB- O
or O
not O
-RRB- O
to O
various O
Greek S-NORP
officials O
for O
services O
rendered O
. O

So O
it O
seems O
that O
Mr. O
Mitsotakis S-PERSON
and O
his O
communist O
chums O
may O
have O
unwittingly O
served O
Mr. O
Papandreou S-PERSON
a O
moral O
victory O
on O
a O
platter O
: O
PASOK S-ORG
, O
whether O
guilty O
or O
not O
, O
can O
now O
traipse O
the O
countryside O
condemning O
the O
whole O
affair O
as O
a O
witch O
hunt O
at O
Mr. O
Papandreou S-PERSON
's O
expense O
. O

But O
while O
verbal O
high O
jinks O
alone O
wo O
n't O
help O
PASOK S-ORG
regain O
power O
, O
Mr. O
Papandreou S-PERSON
should O
never O
be O
underestimated O
. O

First S-ORDINAL
came O
his O
predictable O
fusillade O
: O
He O
charged O
the O
Coalition B-ORG
of I-ORG
the I-ORG
Left E-ORG
and O
Progress S-ORG
had O
sold O
out O
its O
leftist O
tenets O
by O
collaborating O
in O
a O
right O
- O
wing O
plot O
aimed O
at O
ousting O
PASOK S-ORG
and O
thwarting O
the O
course O
of O
socialism O
in O
Greece S-GPE
. O

Then O
, O
to O
buttress O
his O
credibility O
with O
the O
left O
, O
he O
enticed O
some O
smaller O
leftist O
parties O
to O
stand O
for O
election O
under O
the O
PASOK S-ORG
banner O
. O

Next O
, O
he O
continued O
to O
court O
the O
communists O
-- O
many O
of O
whom O
feel O
betrayed O
by O
the O
left O
- O
right O
coalition O
's O
birth O
-- O
by O
bringing O
into O
PASOK S-ORG
a O
well O
- O
respected O
Communist B-ORG
Party E-ORG
candidate O
. O

For O
balance O
, O
and O
in O
hopes O
of O
gaining O
some O
disaffected O
centrist O
votes O
, O
he O
managed O
to O
attract O
a O
former O
New B-ORG
Democracy I-ORG
Party E-ORG
representative O
and O
known O
political O
enemy O
of O
Mr. O
Mitsotakis S-PERSON
. O

Thus O
PASOK S-ORG
heads O
for O
the O
polls O
not O
only O
with O
diminished O
scandal O
- O
stench O
, O
but O
also O
with O
`` O
seals O
of O
approval O
'' O
from O
representatives O
of O
its O
harshest O
accusers O
. O

Crucial O
as O
these O
elections O
are O
for O
Greece S-GPE
, O
pressing O
issues O
of O
state O
are O
getting O
lost O
in O
the O

The O
country O

future O
NATO S-ORG
participation O
remains O
unsure O
, O
for O
instance O

Greece S-GPE
also O
must O

for O
the O
1992 S-DATE

of O

Common O

Greece S-GPE

bilateral O
relations O
with O
the O

need O
attention O
soon O
as O
well O
. O

For O
one S-CARDINAL
, O
the O
current O
accord O
concerning O
U.S. S-GPE
military O
bases O
in O
Greece S-GPE
lapses O
in O
May B-DATE
1990 E-DATE
. O

Negotiations O
for O
a O
new O
agreement O
were O
frozen O
before O
the O
June S-DATE
elections O
, O
but O
the O
clock O
is O
running O

Another O
matter O
of O
concern O
is O
the O
extradition O
of O
Mohammed B-PERSON
Rashid E-PERSON
, O
a O
Palestinian S-NORP
terrorist O
who O

for O
the O
1982 S-DATE
bombing O
of O
a O

The O
Greek S-NORP
courts O
have O
decided O
in O
favor O
of O
extradition O
in O
the O
Rashid S-PERSON
case O
, O
but O
the O
matter O
awaits O
final O
approval O
from O
Greece S-GPE
's O
next O
justice O
minister O
. O

The O
Greeks S-NORP
seem O
barely O
aware O
of O
the O
importance O
of O
the O
case O
as O
a O
litmus O
test O
of O
whether O
Greece S-GPE
will O
be O
counted O
in O
or O
out O
for O
international O
efforts O
to O
combat O
terrorism O
. O

That O
PASOK S-ORG
could O
win O
the O
elections O
outright O
is O
improbable O
; O
the O
Greek S-NORP
press O
, O
previously O
eager O
to O
palm O
off O
PASOK S-ORG

line O
, O
has O
turned O
on O
Mr. O

vengeance O

Yet O
the O
possibility O
of O
another O

up O

is O
all O
too O
real O
. O

If O
Mr. O
Papandreou S-PERSON
becomes O
the O
major O
opposition O
leader O
, O
he O
could O
hamstring O
a O
conservative O

-LRB- O
YES O
-RRB- O
plan O
, O
though O
its O
details O
remain O
to O

specified O

What O
is O
one O
to O
think O
of O
all O
this O
? O

Doctrine O
and O
special O
interests O
govern O
some O
responses O
. O

People O
eager O
to O
have O
youth O
`` O
pay O
their O
dues O
to O
society O
'' O
favor O
service O
proposals O
-- O
preferably O
mandatory O
ones O
. O

So O
do O
those O
who O
seek O
a O
`` O
re-energized O
concept O
of O
citizenship O
, O
'' O
a O
concept O
imposing O
stern O
obligations O
as O
well O
as O
conferring O
rights O
. O

Then O
there O
are O
instinctive O
opponents O
. O

To O
libertarians O
, O
mandatory O
service O
is O
an O
abomination O
and O
voluntary O
systems O
are O
illegitimate O
uses O
of O
tax O
money O
. O

Devotees O
of O
the O
market O
question O
the O
value O
of O
the O
work O
national O
service O
would O
perform O
: O

If O
the O
market O
wo O
n't O
pay O
for O
it O
, O
they O
argue O
, O
it O
ca O
n't O
be O
worth O
its O
cost O
. O

Elements O
of O
the O
left O
are O
also O
reflexively O
opposed O
; O
they O
see O
service O
as O
a O
cover O
for O
the O
draft O
, O
or O
fear O
the O
regimentation O
of O
youth O
, O
or O
want O
to O
see O
rights O
enlarged O
, O
not O
obligations O
. O

But O
what O
about O
those O
of O
us O
whose O
views O
are O
not O
predetermined O
by O
formula O
or O
ideology O
? O

How O
should O
we O
think O
about O
national O
service O
? O

Let O
's O
begin O
by O
recognizing O
a O
main O
source O
of O
confusion O
-- O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
has O
no O
agreed O
meaning O
. O

Would O
service O
be O
voluntary O
or O
compulsory O
? O

Short O
or O
long O
? O

Part O
- O
time O
or O
full O
- O
time O
? O

Paid O
or O
unpaid O
? O

Would O
participants O
live O
at O
home O
and O
work O
nearby O
or O
live O
in O
barracks O
and O
work O
on O
public O
lands O
? O

What O
kinds O
of O
work O
would O
they O
do O
? O

What O
does O
`` O
national O
'' O
mean O
? O

Would O
the O
program O
be O
run O
by O
the O
federal O
government O
, O
by O
local O
governments O
, O
or O
by O
private O
voluntary O
organizations O
? O

And O
who O
would O
serve O
? O

Only O
males O
, O
as O
with O
the O
draft O
, O
or O
both O
sexes O
? O

Youth O
only O
or O
all O
ages O
? O

Middle O
- O
class O
people O
, O
or O
poor O
people O
, O
or O
a O
genuine O
cross-section O
? O

Many O
or O
few O
? O

Those O
are O
not O
trivial O
questions O
, O
and O
the O
label O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
answers O
none O
of O
them O
. O

Then O
how O
should O
we O
think O
about O
national O
service O
? O

As O
a O
starting O
point O
, O
here O
are O
five S-CARDINAL
propositions O
: O
1 S-CARDINAL
. O
Consider O
the O
ingredients O
, O
not O
the O
name O
. O

Ignore O
`` O
national O
service O
'' O
in O
the O
abstract O
; O
consider O
specific O
proposals O
. O

They O
will O
differ O
in O
crucial O
ways O
. O

2 S-CARDINAL
. O
`` O
Service O
'' O
should O
be O
service O
. O

As O
commonly O
understood O
, O
service O
implies O
sacrifice O
. O

It O
involves O
accepting O
risk O
, O
or O
giving O
up O
income O
, O
or O
deferring O
a O
career O
. O

It O
follows O
that O
proposals O
like O
Nunn S-PERSON
- O
McCurdy O
, O
whose O
benefits O
to O
enrollees O
are O
worth O
some O
$ O
17,500 S-MONEY
a B-DATE
year E-DATE
, O
do O
not O
qualify O
. O

There O
is O
a O
rationale O
for O
such O
bills O
: O
Federal O
subsidies O
to O
college O
students O
amount O
to O
`` O
a B-LAW
GI I-LAW
Bill E-LAW
without O
the O
GI O
'' O
; O
arguably O
those O
benefits O
should O
be O
earned O
, O
not O
given O
. O

But O
the O
earnings O
exceed O
by O
20 B-PERCENT
% E-PERCENT
the O
average O
income O
of O
young O
high O
- O
school O
graduates O
with O
full O
- O
time O
jobs O
. O

Why O
call O
that O
service O
? O

3 S-CARDINAL
. O
Encouragement O
is O
fine O
; O
compulsion O
is O
not O
. O

Compelled O
service O
is O
unconstitutional O
. O

It O
is O
also O
unwise O
and O
unenforceable O
. O

-LRB- O
Who O
will O
throw O
several B-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL
refusers O
in O
jail O
each O
year O
? O
-RRB- O

But O
through O
tax O
policy O
and O
in O
other O
ways O
the O
federal O
government O
encourages O
many O
kinds O
of O
behavior O
. O

It O
should O
also O
encourage O
service O
-- O
preferably O
by O
all O
classes O
and O
all O
ages O
. O

Its O
encouragement O
should O
strengthen O
and O
not O
undercut O
the O
strong O
tradition O
of O
volunteering O
in O
the O
U.S. S-GPE
, O
should O
build O
on O
the O
service O
programs O
already O
in O
existence O
, O
and O
should O
honor O
local O
convictions O
about O
which O
tasks O
most O
need O
doing O
. O

4 S-CARDINAL
. O
Good O
programs O
are O
not O
cheap O
. O

Enthusiasts O
assume O
that O
national O
service O
would O
get O
important O
work O
done O
cheaply O
: O
forest O
fires O
fought O
, O
housing O
rehabilitated O
, O
students O
tutored O
, O
day O
- O
care O
centers O
staffed O
. O

There O
is O
important O
work O
to O
be O
done O
, O
and O
existing O
service O
and O
conservation O
corps O
have O
shown O
that O
even O
youths O
who O
start O
with O
few O
skills O
can O
do O
much O
of O
it O
well O
-- O
but O
not O
cheaply O
. O

Good O
service O
programs O
require O
recruitment O
, O
screening O
, O
training O
and O
supervision O
-- O
all O
of O
high O
quality O
. O

They O
involve O
stipends O
to O
participants O
. O

Full O
- O
time O
residential O
programs O
also O
require O
housing O
and O
full O
- O
time O
supervision O
; O
they O
are O
particularly O
expensive O
-- O
more O
per O
participant O
than O
a B-DATE
year E-DATE
at O
Stanford S-ORG
or O
Yale S-ORG
. O

Non-residential O
programs O
are O
cheaper O
, O
but O
good O
ones O
still O
come O
to O
some O
$ O
10,000 S-MONEY
a O
year O
. O

Are O
they O
worth O
that O
? O

Evaluations O
suggest O
that O
good O
ones O
are O
-- O
especially O
so O
if O
the O
effects O
on O
participants O
are O
counted O
. O

But O
the O
calculations O
are O
challengeable O
. O

5 S-CARDINAL
. O
Underclass O
youth O
are O
a O
special O
concern O
. O

Are O
such O
expenditures O
worthwhile O
, O
then O
? O

Yes O
, O
if O
targeted O
. O

People O
of O
all O
ages O
and O
all O
classes O
should O
be O
encouraged O
to O
serve O
, O
but O
there O
are O
many O
ways O
for O
middle O
- O
class O
kids O
, O
and O
their O
elders O
, O
to O
serve O
at O
little O
public O
cost O
. O

They O
can O
volunteer O
at O
any O
of O
thousands S-CARDINAL
of O
non-profit O
institutions O
, O
or O
participate O
in O
service O
programs O
required O
by O
high O
schools O
or O
encouraged O
by O
colleges O
or O
employers O
. O

Underclass O
youth O
do O
n't O
have O
those O
opportunities O
. O

They O
are O
not O
enrolled O
in O
high O
school O
or O
college O
. O

They O
are O
unlikely O
to O
be O
employed O
. O

And O
they O
have O
grown O
up O
in O
unprecedentedly O
grim O
circumstances O
, O
among O
family O
structures O
breaking O
down O
, O
surrounded O
by O
self O
- O
destructive O
behaviors O
and O
bleak O
prospects O
. O

But O
many O
of O
them O
can O
be O
quite O
profoundly O
reoriented O
by O
productive O
and O
disciplined O
service O
. O

Some O
wo O
n't O
accept O
the O
discipline O
; O
others O
drop O
out O
for O
other O
reasons O

But O
some O

nothing O

are O
transformed O

they O
are O
no O

others O
now O
depend O

with O

, O
the O

on O

alter O
the O

Strictly O
speaking O
, O
these O

are O
not O
performing O

. O

They O
are O
giving O
up O
no O

, O
deferring O
no O

, O
incurring O
no O

But O
they O
believe O
themselves O

`` O
We O

'' O

Mr. O
Baldwin S-PERSON
is O
also O
attacking O
the O
greater O
problem O
: O
lack O
of O
ringers O
. O

One O
survey O
says O
that O
of O
the O
100,000 S-CARDINAL
trained O
bellringers O
in O
England S-GPE
today S-DATE
, O
only B-CARDINAL
40,000 E-CARDINAL
of O
them O
still O
ring O
. O

Also O
, O
ringers O
do O
n't O
always O
live O
where O
the O
bells O
need O
to O
be O
rung O
-- O
like O
in O

But O
the O
council O

program O
to O
attract O
and O
train O
ringers O
is O
only O
partly O
successful O
, O
says O
Mr. O
Baldwin S-PERSON
. O

`` O
Right O
now O
, O
we O
're O
lucky O

adds O

One S-CARDINAL
bright O
sign O
is O
that O
a O

The O
two S-CARDINAL

, O
Alexander B-PERSON

last B-DATE
Saturday I-DATE

when O

reached O
a O

It O
was O

that O
man O

foot O
had O
not O
stepped O
on O
this O
place O
for O
a O
long O
time O

. O

The O
two S-CARDINAL
students O
entered O
the O
fortification O
where O
they O
found O
old O
medical O

a O
number O

a O

as O

a O

The O
two S-CARDINAL
students O
took O
the O
pendant O
home O
with O
them O
and O
cleaned O
it O
and O
washed O
it O
. O

They O
were O
surprised O
that O
it O
did O
not O
belong O
to O
an O
Israeli S-NORP

because O
the O
writing O
on O

was O
in O

they O
did O
not O
understand O
anything O
that O
was O

The O
two S-CARDINAL

took O
the O
pendant O
with O
them O
to O

tried O
to O
consult O
the O

find O
out O
what O

It O
turned O
out O
that O
it O
belonged O
to O
a O
Syrian S-NORP
soldier O
whose O
name O
was O
Mahmoud B-PERSON
bin I-PERSON
Ali E-PERSON
. O

His O
military O
serial O
number O
was O
16241 S-CARDINAL

and O
the O

also O
indicated O
that O

said O
that O
from O
the O
descriptions O
of O
the O
place O

the O

given O
by O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
boys O
, O
they O
go O
back O
to O
the O

, O
because O

The O
officer O
added O
that O
the O
presence O
of O
the O
pendant O
in O
the O
place O
together O
with O
medicines O
and O
medical O
equipment O
indicates O
that O
the O
soldier O
was O
injured O

and O
it O
is O
probable O
that O
his O
fate O

still O
unknown O

his O
family O

and O
no O
one O

what O

contaminated O
new O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

So O
they O
decided O
to O
get O
rid O
of O
him O
with O
a O
confused O
and O
embarrassing O
hastiness O
. O

Thanks O
to O
the O
technology O
of O
the O
mobile O
phone O
which O
enabled O
us O
to O
recognize O
the O
ugly O
face O
of O
the O
hateful O
sectarianism O
that O
is O
governing O
in O
America S-GPE
's O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

This O
tape O
exposed O
the O
government O
of O
the B-GPE
Green I-GPE
Zone E-GPE
, O
and O
blew O
up O
all O
the O
plans O
for O
censorship O
and O
fraud O
by O
the O
experts O
of O
the O
American S-NORP
Intelligence O
service O
and O
their O
agents O
. O

It O
presented O
us O
with O
the O
naked O
truth O
, O
without O
that O
being O
the O
intention O
of O
its O
owner O
. O

He O
was O
right O
when O
he O
turned O
to O
them O
and O
said O
, O
" O
Are O
these O
your O
men O
? O
" O
when O
they O
were O
directing O
insults O
at O
him O
while O
he O
was O
proceeding O
to O
the O
gallows O
in O
magnanimity O
and O
with O
self O
- O
respect O
, O
repeating O
the O
noble O
words O
, O
" O
and O
when O
the O
ignorant O
address O
them O
they O
say O
' O
peace O
. O
' O
" O

Is O
it O
manliness O
to O
shout O
hateful O
sectarian O
slogans O
in O
front O
of O
a O
man O
who O
has O
never O
been O
sectarian O
, O
and O
the O
rope O
of O
the O
gallows O
is O
being O
wound O
around O
his O
neck O
, O
and O
his O
soul O
will O
go O
to O
its O
Creator O
in O
a O
few O
seconds O
? O

Are O
these O
the O
tolerant O
ethics O
of O
Islam S-ORG
? O

Are O
these O
the O
values O
of O
Arabism S-NORP
, O
decency O
, O
and O
pride O
? O

Are O
those O
the O
sons O
of O
the O
great O
Iraq S-GPE
which O
had O
always O
stood O
up O
against O
invaders O
throughout O
history O
and O
was O
a O
pillar O
of O
support O
for O
its O
nation O
and O
the O
causes O
of O
justice O
in O
the O
world O
as O
a O
whole O
? O

We O
are O
sorry O
, O
but O
not O
surprised O
, O
because O
some O
Arab S-NORP
governments O
objected O
only O
because O
the O
execution O
took O
place O
on O
the B-DATE
day I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
feast I-DATE
of I-DATE
Bairam E-DATE
, O
as O
if O
the O
execution O
of O
this O
man O
would O
have O
been O
permissible O
and O
blessed O
on O
any B-DATE
other I-DATE
day E-DATE
. O

We O
are O
sorry O
again O
because O
most O
of O
the O
Arab S-NORP
leaders O
hid O
in O
their O
palaces O
and O
none O
of O
them O
dared O
to O
speak O
even O
one S-CARDINAL
word O
of O
protest O
out O
of O
fear O
of O
America S-GPE
. O

We O
were O
stabbed O
twice O
, O
first S-ORDINAL
when O
we O
watched O
an O
Arab S-NORP
leader O
being O
led O
to O
the O
gallows O
in O
accordance O
with O
sectarian O
justice O
which O
is O
spiteful O
and O
vengeful O
. O
And O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
time O
when O
we O
did O
not O
see O
anyone O
among O
the O
club O
of O
leaders O
to O
which O
he O
belonged O
for O
more O
than O
30 S-CARDINAL
years O
object O
to O
his O
execution O
. O

Maybe O
God O
wanted O
a O
good O
end O
for O
him O
, O
and O
a O
good O
reputation O
, O
when O
He O
induced O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
them O
to O
record O
what O
America S-GPE
and O
the O
government O
of O
sects O
wanted O
to O
hide O
, O
by O
means O
of O
the O
video O
of O
the O
last S-ORDINAL
moments O
, O
which O
created O
a O
historic O
turning O
point O
that O
will O
perhaps O
shape O
the O
history O
of O
the O
region O
, O
and O
the O
nature O
of O
events O
in O
it O
for O
decades B-DATE
to I-DATE
come E-DATE
. O

Maybe O
God O
wanted O
to O
expose O
the O
series O
of O
lies O
of O
Muwaffaq B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Rabi E-PERSON
the O
National O
Security O
Advisor O
in O
the O
government O
of O
occupation O
. O
-LRB- O
Where O
is O
that O
security O
? O
-RRB- O
, O
who O
went O
out O
to O
the O
world O
saying O
that O
he O
, O
meaning O
President O
Saddam S-PERSON
, O
was O
weak O
and O
collapsing O
while O
he O
was O
on O
his O
way O
to O
meet O
his O
God O
. O

Then O
the O
tape O
comes O
along O
and O
shows O
us O
with O
sound O
and O
image O
that O
we O
are O
in O
front O
of O
a O
courageous O
lion O
, O
who O
refuses O
to O
wear O
the O
mask O
, O
just O
as O
he O
refused O
to O
take O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
they O
offered O
him O
. O



Why O
the O
mask O
, O
and O
why O
the O
pills O
? O

The O
mask O
is O
for O
traitors O
and O
criminals O
who O
are O
ashamed O
of O
their O
treason O
or O
their O
crimes O
, O
and O
the O
tranquilizing O
pills O
are O
appropriate O
for O
those O
who O
can O
not O
face O
history O
because O
of O
their O
bad O
deeds O
. O

The O
American S-NORP
administration O
committed O
a O
fatal O
mistake O
and O
revealed O
a O
major O
foolishness O
to O
be O
added O
to O
its O
many O
foolishnesses O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
when O
it O
executed O
this O
man O
, O
in O
a O
way O
for O
which O
it O
will O
pay O
a O
hefty O
price O
in O
the B-DATE
near I-DATE
future E-DATE
. O

His O
survival O
would O
have O
benefited O
it O
much O
more O
than O
his O
execution O
if O
they O
understood O
politics O
as O
they O
should O
, O
because O
his O
survival O
could O
have O
been O
a O
card O
to O
threaten O
the O
sectarians O
and O
keep O
them O
as O
servants O
to O
them O
and O
their O
schemes O
, O
just O
as O
it O
could O
have O
been O
a O
bargaining O
chip O
for O
calming O
down O
the O
resistance O
and O
the O
broad O
Iraqi S-NORP
sector O
which O
supports O
it O
. O

But O
they O
do O
not O
know O
anything O
except O
grudges O
, O
and O
they O
do O
not O
want O
anything O
other O
than O
inflicting O
more O
degradation O
on O
the O
Arabs S-NORP
and O
Muslims S-NORP
by O
his O
execution O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
American S-NORP
administration O
will O
have O
succeeded O
in O
one S-CARDINAL
thing O
only O
, O
intentionally O
and O
with O
planning O
or O
without O
it O
, O
namely O
, O
deepening O
the O
sectarian O
breach O
not O
only O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
but O
in O
the O
Islamic S-NORP
world O
as O
a O
whole O
. O

It O
was O
not O
by O
coincidence O
that O
Nouri B-PERSON
al I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
Maliki E-PERSON
signed O
the O
decision O
to O
carry O
out O
the O
execution O
. O

And O
it O
was O
also O
not O
a O
matter O
of O
coincidence O
that O
the O
task O
of O
carrying O
it O
out O
was O
assigned O
to O
spiteful O
sectarians O
as O
we O
have O
seen O
in O
the O
videotape O
. O

Al B-PERSON

the O
American S-NORP
occupation O
and O
gave O
it O
a O
legitimate O
cover O
, O
from O
the O

This O
execution O
will O
deal O
a O
strong O
blow O
to O
all O
the O
efforts O
of O
national O
reconciliation O
. O

It O
will O
lead O
to O
the O
escalation O
of O
attacks O
against O
the O
American S-NORP
forces O
and O
those O
cooperating O
with O
it O

It O

pour O
more O
oil O
on O
the O
fire O
of O
the O
civil O

that O
has O
already O
been O

. O

Those O
who O
carried O
out O
the O
death O
sentence O
do O
not O
want O
reconciliation O
or O
to O
maintain O
a O
unified O
Iraq S-GPE

Rather O
, O
they O
are O
working O
to O
blow O
it O
up O
; O
tolerance O
, O
forgiveness O
, O
and O
patience O
are O
basic O
characteristics O
not O
found O
in O
those O
people O
. O

Saddam S-PERSON
had O
negative O
traits O
and O
positive O
traits O
, O
but O
he O
was O
not O
killed O
because O
of O
his O
negative O
traits O
, O
but O
rather O
because O
of O
his O
positive O
traits O
, O
which O
were O
his O
belief O
in O
Arab S-NORP
unity O
, O
resistance O
to O
the O
enemies O
of O

nation O
, O
building O
an O

and O
challenging O
America S-GPE

He O
chose O
resistance O
and O
rejected O
safe O

. O

The O

after O
much O
major O
work O
on O

, O
many O
people O
feel O
that O
the O

are O
limited O

and O
in O
extreme O
cases O
the O
result O
is O
n't O
beauty O

disfigurement O

Why O
is O
this O
? O

In O
the O
view O
of O
clinical O
dermatologists O
, O
the O
results O
at O
beauty O
salons O
are O
not O
obvious O
and O
there O
may O
even O
be O
problems O
. O

In O
fact O
because O
not O
only O
is O
the O
consumer O
unlucky O
, O
not O
choosing O
the O
right O
beauty O
salon O
, O
but O
to O
a O
great O
extent O
this O
is O
determined O
by O
whether O

I O
have O
kept O
the O
good O
habit O
of O
having O
my O
teeth O
cleaned O
ever O
since O
I O
knew O
it O
could O
claim O
my O
life O
if O
I O
abruptly O
go O
to O
clean O
my O
teeth O
after O
years S-DATE
of O
leaving O
them O
uncleaned O
. O

After O
my O
still O
upright O
but O
" O
left O
- O
tilting O
" O
teeth O
crouched O
in O
my O
mouth O
safely O
and O
soundly O
for O
another B-DATE
two I-DATE
years E-DATE
, O
another O
revolution O
erupted O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
year E-DATE
after O
I O
graduated O
and O
found O
a O
job O
. O

The O
revolution O
could O
be O
said O
a O
rudimentary O
one O
, O
which O
made O
me O
decide O
eventually O
to O
eliminate O
all O
the O
betrayers O
and O
heretics O
in O
one O
action O
!. O

The O
incident O
was O
caused O
by O
a O
molar O
. O

The O
location O
of O
the O
tooth O
was O
just O
next O
to O
the O
broken O
wisdom O
tooth O
that O
led O
to O
my O
first S-ORDINAL
visit O
to O
an O
American S-NORP
dentist O
. O

For O
some O
unknown O
reason O
, O
when O
I O
was O
eating O
the O
other O
day O
, O
the O
tooth O
suddenly O
ached O
during O
the O
meal O
, O
and O
it O
was O
very O
painful O
. O

Unexpected O
I O
heard O
a O
" O
crack O
" O
while O
I O
was O
eating O
, O
and O
part O
of O
the O
tooth O
fell O
off O
!. O

I O
could O
not O
remember O
eating O
anything O
hard O
?!. O

I O
rushed O
to O
the O
dentist O
, O
who O
said O
root O
canal O
therapy O
upon O
seeing O
it O
, O
your O
dental O
nerve O
had O
come O
out O
!. O

I O
did O
not O
know O
what O
root O
canal O
meant O
but O
thought O
the O
name O
was O
quite O
fancy O
. O

It O
was O
after O
I O
began O
to O
receive O
it O
that O
I O
found O
it O
really O
painful O
!. O

For O
example O
killing O
the O
nerves O
, O
and O
dealing O
with O
the O
dental O
crown O
... O

I O
asked O
the O
dentist O
then O
why O
my O
tooth O
broke O
. O

After O
examining O
my O
25 S-CARDINAL
teeth O
, O
the O
dentist O
told O
me O
seriously O
that O
the O
teeth O
on O
the O
right O
side O
were O
somewhat O
" O
cross O
biting O
" O
due O
to O
the O
" O
parallel O
shift O
" O
of O
my O
teeth O
, O
such O
that O
the O
upper O
and O
lower O
right O
teeth O
were O
always O
against O
each O
other O
. O

The O
wrong O
position O
had O
led O
to O
uneven O
abrasions O
, O
resulting O
in O
the O
broken O
tooth O
. O

I O
asked O
what O
solutions O
are O
available O
? O

The O
dentist O
said O
" O
correction O
. O
" O

Thus O
, O
three B-DATE
years E-DATE
after O
I O
ran O
away O
from O
the O
" O
brigand O
orthodontist O
, O
" O
I O
stepped O
into O
the O
orthodontist O
's O
office O
again O
... O

-- O

Hard O
work O
without O
talent O
is O
a O
shame O
, O
but O
talent O
without O
hardwork O
is O
a O
tragedy O
! O

I O

I O
hear O
she O
was O
a O
talented O
beauty O
. O

What O
a O
great O
pity O
! O

The O
accident O
was O
a O
car O
crash O
. O

Much O
of O
the O
entertainment O
news O
denounced O
that O
+her O
car O
's O
front O
airbag O
failed O
to O
release O
, O
which O
caused O
the O
death O
. O

In O
fact O
, O
the B-PRODUCT
MINI I-PRODUCT
COOPER E-PRODUCT
she O
was O
riding O
in O
is O
not O
what O
the O
reports O
said O
. O

It O
is O
the O
car O
with O
the O
highest O
safety O
index O
. O

It O
is O
sold O
for O
190,000 B-MONEY

. O

Polo S-PRODUCT
also O
sells O
for O
more O
than O
140,000 B-MONEY
HK I-MONEY
dollars E-MONEY
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
cute O
little O
car O
, O
preferred O
by O
girls O
. O

But O
safety O
is O
surely O
not O
too O
big O
of O
a O
problem O
. O

The O
collision O
happened O
on O
the O
side O
and O
rear O
. O

So O
, O
the O
side O
airbag O
and O
air O
curtain O
were O
fully O
opened O
. O

They O
opened O
at O
the O
time O
of O
first S-ORDINAL
collision O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
. O

The O
first S-ORDINAL
collision O
was O
with O
the O
protective O
fence O
only O
, O
and O
the O
impact O
on O
the O
people O
was O
very O
small O
. O

In O
addition O
, O
there O
was O
the O
protection O
of O
the O
air O
curtain O
. O

So O
, O
there O
would O
surely O
not O
be O
a O
big O
problem O
. O

The O
real O
fatal O
collision O
was O
the O
second S-ORDINAL
one O
from O
the O
tailgating O
truck O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
all O
the O
airbags O
were O
already O
deflated O
. O

There O
was O
no O
protective O
effect O
. O

Furthermore O
, O
the O
force O
of O
this O
one O
was O
extremely O
large O
. O

If O
the O
car O
had O
been O
stopped O
at O
an O
angle O
, O
then O
the O
head O
of O
the O
person O
sitting O
on O
one O
side O
would O
surely O
have O
hit O
the O
glass O
or O
the O
B O
column O
. O

Meanwhile O
, O
there O
would O
not O
have O
been O
too O
much O
of O
a O
problem O
for O
someone O
on O
the O
other O
side O
. O

This O
is O
common O
knowledge O
. O

Then O
it O
came O
down O
to O
who O
had O
the O
bad O
luck O
of O
sitting O
on O
the O
side O
of O
the O
car O
that O
was O
angled O
out O
. O

It O
was O
perfectly O
correct O
for O
the O
front O
airbag O
not O
to O
open O
, O
because O
the O
front O
of O
the O
car O
was O
not O
damaged O
at O
all O
. O

None O
of O
the O
sensors O
received O
any O
signal O
of O
a O
collision O
. O

Just O
imagine O
, O
this O
was O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

The O
people O
went O
backward O
abruptly O
. O

Their O
bodies O
could O
have O
been O
supported O
by O
the O
seats O
, O
but O
the O
impact O
on O
their O
necks O
and O
heads O
was O
tremendous O
. O

When O
they O
went O
abruptly O
backward O
, O
any O
additional O
misfortune O
of O
the O
front O
airbag O
opening O
for O
no O
reason O
would O
have O
eliminated O
any O
chance O
of O
survival O
. O

So O
, O
of O
all O
the O
cars O
in O
the O
world O
, O
even O
a O
Rolls B-PRODUCT
- I-PRODUCT
Royce E-PRODUCT
, O
the O
front O
airbag O
will O
not O
open O
during O
a O
rear O
collision O
. O

If O
the O
front O
airbag O
opened O
after O
being O
tailgated O
, O
that O
would O
be O
a O
quality O
problem O
, O
and O
would O
be O
extremely O
dangerous O
. O

The O
safety O
airbag O
's O
eruption O
could O
knock O
someone O
to O
death O
. O

So O
, O
infants O
are O
strictly O
forbidden O
from O
sitting O
in O
the O
front O
seat O
. O

That O
was O
how O
the O
whole O
accident O
took O
place O
. O

The O
result O
of O
the O
accident O
investigation O
division O
will O
not O
be O
different O
from O
this O
. O

For O
this O
kind O
of O
accident O
, O
conclusions O
can O
be O
drawn O
from O
a O
single O
glance O
at O
the O
car O
wreckage O
. O

The O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
have O
no O
fault O
. O

All O
of O
the O
car O
's O
passive O
safety O
protections O
had O
already O
fully O
carried O
out O
their O
functions O
. O

So O
, O
it O
is O
extremely O
ridiculous O
and O
unscientific O
to O
blame O
and O
suspect O
the O
car O
and O
the O
car O
manufacturer O
for O
such O
an O
accident O
. O

In O
particular O
, O
speculation O
about O
why O
the O
front O
airbags O
did O
not O
open O
was O
very O
amateurish O
. O

Only O
by O
not O
opening O
would O
it O
have O
been O
correct O
. O

If O
they O
had O
opened O
, O
her O
assistant O
might O
still O
be O
lying O
in O
the O
hospital O
. O

If O
an O
accident O
occurs O
on O
the O
freeway O
, O
please O
get O
out O
of O
the O
car O
and O
leave O
immediately O
if O
you O
can O
move O
. O

Many O
freeway O
accidents O
occur O
simply O
because O
people O
stay O
inside O
the O
car O
and O
sort O
out O
their O
thoughts O
, O
following O
which O
there O
is O
a O
fatal O
crash O
from O
a O
car O
following O
behind O
. O

About O
death O
, O
I O
have O
always O
believed O
that O
they O
do O
not O
leave O
the O
world O
. O

They O
only O
leave O
the O
human O
world O
. O

They O
are O
surely O
sharing O
the O
same O
world O
with O
us O
, O
with O
a O
different O
manifestation O
of O
life O
. O

-- O

It O
is O
in O
change O
that O
we O
find O
purpose O
. O

Economic I-PERSON
Notes E-PERSON

This O
morning O
I O
went O
to O
the O
supermarket O
with O
Dad O
, O
and O
when O
it O
came O
time O
to O
check O
out O
I O
discovered O
something O
that O
everybody O
probably O
knows O
: O
not O
everybody O
buys O
the O
same O
things O
. O

Of O
course O
this O
is O
a O
no O
- O
brainer O
, O
but O
this O
is O
actually O
a O
major O
problem O
faced O
by O
me O
and O
many O
other O
people O
whenever O
we O
discuss O
economic O
issues O
or O
economic O
phenomena O
. O

Most O
of O
the O
time O
, O
economic O
policy O
and O
economic O
theory O
are O
not O
aimed O
at O
individuals O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
probability O
, O
if O
you O
explain O
the O
behavior O
of O
a O
specific O
individual O
, O
for O
example O
your O
uncle O
, O
using O
any O
economic O
theory O
, O
the O
probability O
that O
it O
will O
be O
accurate O
is O
virtually O
0 S-CARDINAL
. O

In O
fact O
, O
in O
the O
great O
majority O
of O
cases O
the O
economic O
theory O
is O
aimed O
at O
an O
entire O
group O
, O
or O
a O
subgroup O
. O

In O
terms O
of O
averages O
, O
accuracy O
is O
the O
goal O
of O
many O
economic O
theories O
-LRB- O
here O
I O
'm O
being O
inaccurate O
; O
I O
hope O
the O
experts O
will O
not O
take O
it O
too O
literally O
, O
especially O
those O
with O
IO O
expertise O
-RRB- O
. O

But O
with O
regard O
to O
an O
ordinary O
person O
, O
he O
may O
never O
see O
the O
whole O
group O
, O
he O
sees O
only O
his O
co-workers O
, O
his O
relatives O
and O
his O
friends O
, O
the O
group O
of O
people O
familiar O
to O
him O
; O
add O
up O
all O
the O
people O
in O
this O
group O
and O
they O
may O
number O
200 S-CARDINAL
, O
and O
that O
is O
already O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
. O

Below O
I O
am O
going O
to O
refer O
to O
these O
200 S-CARDINAL
people O
collectively O
as O
" O
his O
uncle O
. O
" O

So O
whenever O
you O
discuss O
an O
economic O
theory O
with O
someone O
, O
the O
response O
of O
a O
perfectly O
ordinary O
person O
would O
be O
: O
My O
uncle O
is O
n't O
like O
that O
, O
so O
this O
theory O
is O
baloney O
. O

In O
other O
words O
, O
everybody O
tends O
to O
mistake O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
. O

Here O
, O
mistaking O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
is O
not O
derogatory O
; O
it O
is O
a O
limitation O
of O
the O
human O
race O
itself O
; O
you O
have O
it O
and O
I O
have O
it O
. O

If O
Americans S-NORP
had O
learned O
not O
to O
mistake O
the O
part O
for O
the O
whole O
, O
they O
might O
not O
have O
made O
such O
a O
mess O
of O
the O
world O
. O

I O
believe O
that O
they O
made O
such O
a O
complete O
mess O
of O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East E-LOC
to O
a O
very O
large O
extent O
because O
they O
applied O
their O
own O
common O
sense O
to O
understanding O
the B-LOC
Middle I-LOC
East E-LOC
, O
which O
is O
a O
completely O
different O
place O
from O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States E-GPE
. O

On O
this O
issue O
, O
China S-GPE
does O
not O
have O
much O
basis O
for O
being O
self O
- O
congratulatory O
; O
China S-GPE
's O
rapid O
rise O
has O
even O
caused O
some O
people O
to O
have O
a O
sort O
of O
misconception O
- O
that O
whatever O
China S-GPE
does O
is O
right O
- O
and O
this O
is O
in O
fact O
a O
manifestation O
of O
narrow O
- O
mindedness O
. O

Therefore O
I O
believe O
it O
is O
extremely O
important O
to O
recognize O
that O
one O
's O
own O
knowledge O
has O
limitations O
. O

We O
need O
to O
maintain O
a O
sufficiently O
open O
attitude O
toward O
things O
that O
do O
n't O
correspond O
to O
our O
common O
sense O
. O

So O
just O
because O
every O
time O
your O
uncle O
goes O
to O
the O
supermarket O
he O
buys O
hog O
head O
meat O
does O
n't O
mean O
that O
we O
should O
immediately O
assume O
that O
any O
theory O
that O
does O
not O
predict O
people O
going O
to O
the O
supermarket O
will O
buy O
hog O
head O
meat O
is O
wrong O
. O

When O
you O
feel O
other O
people O
are O
talking O
baloney O
, O
and O
what O
other O
people O
say O
does O
not O
correspond O
to O
your O
" O
common O
sense O
, O
" O
you O
should O
at O
the O
same O
time O
recognize O
that O
your O
uncle O
is O
only O
your O
uncle O
, O
he O
is O
not O
the O
whole O
world O
. O

Qingqing S-PERSON

Qingqing S-PERSON

At O

Qingqing S-PERSON

After O

I O

I O
will O
never O
be O
a O
Government S-ORG
official O
and O
I O
have O
no O

information O

My O
perspective O
is O
entirely O
based O
on O
what O
I O
see O
, O
on O
what O
I O
read O
and O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
my O
family O
has O
lived O
in O
this O
region O
for O
almost B-DATE
200 I-DATE
years E-DATE
. O

You O
may O
regard O
my O
views O
as O
those O
of O
the O
proverbial O
taxi O
driver O
, O
which O
you O
are O
supposed O
to O
question O

when O
you O

I O
could O
have O
shared O
with O
you O
some O
fascinating O
facts O
and O
some O
personal O
thoughts O
about O
the B-EVENT
Israeli I-EVENT

conflict E-EVENT

However O
, O
I O
will O
touch O
upon O
it O
only O
in O
passing O

I O
prefer O
to O
devote O
most O
of O
my O
remarks O
to O
the O
broader O
picture O
of O
the O
region O
and O
its O
place O
in O
world O
events O
. O

I O
refer O
to O
the O
entire O
area O
between O
Pakistan S-GPE

Morocco S-GPE
, O
which O
is O
predominantly O
Arab S-NORP

predominantly O
Moslem S-NORP
, O
but O
includes O
many O
non-Arab S-NORP
and O
also O
significant O
non-Moslem S-NORP
minorities O
. O

Why O
do O
I O
put O
aside O
Israel S-GPE
and O
its O
own O
immediate O

? O

Because O
Israel S-GPE

that O

all O

happening O
in O
a O

which O
only O

was O

the O

some O

one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
most O
advanced O

It O
is O
fair O
to O

that O
this O
creates O
an O
unprecedented O
breeding O

for O
cruel O

It O

A O
word O
about O
the O
millions S-CARDINAL
of O
decent O

honest O
, O
good O
people O
who O
are O
either O
devout O
Moslems S-NORP

are O
not O
very O
religious O
but O
grew O
up O
in O
Moslem S-NORP
families O
: O

They O
are O
double O
victims O
of O
an O
outside O

, O
which O
now O
develops O
Islamophobia O

and O
of O
their O
own O

which O
breaks O
their O

totally O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
vast O
silent O
majority O
of O
these O
Moslems S-NORP
are O
not O
part O
of O
the O
terror O
and O
the O

but O
they O
also O
do O
not O
stand O
up O
political O
leaders O

business O
people O

many O
others O

Many O
of O

can O
certainly O
tell O
right O

are O
afraid O

express O
their O

The O
events O
of O
the B-DATE

few I-DATE

have O
amplified O
four S-CARDINAL
issues O

which O
have O
always O

but O
have O
never O
been O
as O
rampant O
as O
in O

A B-DATE

it O

World I-EVENT

but O
we O
are O
already O
well O
into O
it O

These O
are O
the O
four S-CARDINAL
main O
pillars O
of O
the O
current O
World O

, O
or O
perhaps O
we O
should O
already O
refer O

`` O

Suicide O

are O
not O
a O

but O
they O
have O
been O
made O
popular O
, O
if O
I O
may O
use O
this O
expression O
, O
only O
lately O

Even O
after O
September B-EVENT
11 E-EVENT
, O
it O
seems O
that O
most O
of O
the B-LOC
Western I-LOC
World E-LOC
does O
not O
yet O
understand O
this O
weapon O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
potent O
psychological O
weapon O
. O

Its O
real O
direct O
impact O
is O
relatively O
minor O

The O
total O
number O

from O

of O
suicide O
murders O
within O
Israel S-GPE
in O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
three I-DATE

is O
much O
smaller O
than O
those O
due O
to O
car O

. O

September O

was O
quantitatively O
much O
less O
lethal O
than O
many O

More O
people O
die O
from O
AIDS O
in O
one B-DATE
day E-DATE
in O
Africa S-LOC
than O
all O
the O
Russians S-NORP
who O
died O
in O
the O
hands O
of O
Chechnya S-GPE

Moslem S-NORP
suicide O
murderers O
since O
that O

Saddam S-PERSON

those O

the O

So O
what O
is O
all O
the O
fuss O
about O
suicide O
killings O
? O

It O
creates O
headlines O
. O

It O
is O
spectacular O
. O

It O
is O
frightening O
. O

It O
is O
a O
very O
cruel O
death O
with O
bodies O
dismembered O
and O
horrible O
severe O
lifelong O
injuries O
to O
many O
of O
the O
wounded O
. O

It O
is O
always O
shown O
on O
television O
in O
great O
detail O
. O

One O
such O
murder O
, O
with O
the O
help O
of O
hysterical O
media O
coverage O
, O
can O
destroy O
the O
tourism O
industry O
of O
a O
country O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
, O
as O
it O
did O
in O
Bali S-GPE
and O
in O
Turkey S-GPE
. O

But O
the O
real O
fear O
comes O
from O
the O
undisputed O
fact O
that O
no O
defense O
and O
no O
preventive O
measures O
can O
succeed O
against O
a O
determined O
suicide O
murderer O
. O

This O
has O
not O
yet O
penetrated O
the O
thinking O
of O
the B-LOC
Western I-LOC
World E-LOC
. O

The O
U.S. S-GPE
and O
Europe S-LOC
are O
constantly O
improving O
their O
defense O
against O
the O
last O
murder O
, O
not O
the O
next O
one O
. O

We O
may O
arrange O
for O
the O
best O
airport O
security O
in O
the O
world O
. O

But O
if O
you O
want O
to O
murder O
by O
suicide O
, O
you O
do O
not O
have O
to O
board O
a O
plane O
in O
order O
to O
explode O
yourself O
and O
kill O
many O
people O
. O

Who O
could O
stop O
a O
suicide O
murder O
in O
the O
midst O
of O
the O
crowded O
line O
waiting O
to O
be O
checked O
by O
the O
airport O
metal O
detector O
? O

How O
about O
the O
lines O
to O
the O
check O
- O
in O
counters O
in O
a O
busy O
travel O
period O
? O

Put O
a O
metal O
detector O
in O
front O
of O
every O
train O
station O
in O
Spain S-GPE
and O
the O
terrorists O
will O
get O
the O
buses O
. O

Protect O
the O
buses O
and O
they O
will O
explode O
in O
movie O
theaters O
, O
concert O
halls O
, O
supermarkets O
, O
shopping O
malls O
, O
schools O
and O
hospitals O
. O

Put O
guards O
in O
front O
of O
every O
concert O
hall O
and O
there O
will O
always O
be O
a O
line O
of O
people O
to O
be O
checked O
by O
the O
guards O

and O
this O
line O
will O
be O
the O
target O
, O
not O
to O
speak O
of O
killing O
the O
guards O
themselves O
. O

You O
can O
somewhat O
reduce O
your O
vulnerability O
by O
preventive O
and O
defensive O
measures O
and O
by O
strict O
border O
controls O
but O
not O
eliminate O
it O
and O
definitely O
not O
win O
the O
war O
in O
a O
defensive O
way O
. O

And O
it O
is O
a O
war O
! O

What O
is O
behind O
the O
suicide O
murders O
? O

Money O
is O
, O
money O
and O
power O
and O
cold O
- O
blooded O
murderous O
incitement O
, O
nothing O
else O
. O

It O
has O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
true O
fanatic O
religious O
beliefs O
. O

No O
Moslem S-NORP
preacher O
has O
ever O
blown O
himself O
up O
. O

No O
son O
of O
an O
Arab S-NORP
politician O
or O
religious O
leader O
has O
ever O
blown O
himself O
up O
. O

No O
relative O
of O
anyone O
influential O
has O
done O
it O
. O

Would O
n't O
you O
expect O
some O
of O
the O
religious O
leaders O
to O
do O
it O
themselves O
, O
or O
to O
talk O
their O
sons O
into O
doing O
it O
, O
if O
this O
is O
truly O
a O
supreme O
act O
of O
religious O
fervor O
? O

Are O
n't O
they O
interested O
in O
the O
benefits O
of O
going O
to O
Heaven O
? O

Instead O
, O
they O
send O
outcast O
women O
, O
naive O
children O
, O
retarded O
people O

young O
incited O
hotheads O

They O
promise O
them O
the O
delights O
, O
mostly O
sexual O

of O
the O
next O

and O
pay O
their O

handsomely O
after O
the O
supreme O
act O
is O
performed O
and O
enough O
innocent O
people O
are O
dead O
. O

Suicide O
murders O
also O
have O
nothing O
to O
do O
with O
poverty O
and O
despair O
. O

The O
poorest O
region O
in O
the O

, O
by O
far O
, O
is O
Africa S-ORG

It O
never O
happens O

desperate O

and O
no O
one O

A O
suicide O

is O
simply O
a O
horrible O
, O
vicious O
weapon O
of O
cruel O
, O
inhuman O
, O
cynical O
, O
well O
- O
funded O
terrorists O

with O
no O
regard O
to O
human O
life O

including O
the O
life O
of O
their O
fellow O

but O
with O
very O
high O
regard O
to O
their O
own O
affluent O
well O
- O
being O
and O
their O
hunger O
for O
power O
. O

The O
only O
way O
to O
fight O
this O
new O
`` O
popular O
'' O
weapon O
is O
identical O
to O
the O
only O
way O
in O
which O
you O
fight O
organized O
crime O
or O
pirates O
on O
the O
high O
seas O
: O
the O
offensive O
way O
. O



Like O
in O
the O
case O
of O
organized O
crime O
, O
it O
is O
crucial O
that O
the O
forces O
on O
the O
offensive O
be O
united O
and O
it O
is O
crucial O
to O
reach O
the O
top O
of O
the O
crime O
pyramid O
. O

You O
can O
not O
eliminate O
organized O
crime O
by O
arresting O
the O
little O
drug O
dealer O
on O
the O
street O
corner O
. O

You O
must O
go O
after O
the O
head O
of O
the O
`` O
Family O
'' O
. O

If O
part O
of O
the O
public O
supports O
it O
, O
others O
tolerate O
it O
, O
many O
are O
afraid O
of O
it O
and O
some O
try O
to O
explain O
it O
away O
by O
poverty O
or O
by O
a O
miserable O
childhood O
, O
organized O
crime O
will O
thrive O
and O
so O
will O
terrorism O
. O

The B-GPE
United I-GPE

this O
now O
, O
after O

. O

Russia S-GPE

beginning O
to O
understand O
it O

I O
am O
very O
much O
afraid O
that O
most O
of O
Europe S-LOC
still O
does O
not O
understand O
it O
. O

Unfortunately O
, O
it O
seems O
that O
Europe S-LOC
will O
understand O
it O
only O
after O
suicide O
murders O
arrive O
in O
Europe S-LOC
in O
a O
big O
way O
. O

In O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
this O
will O
definitely O
happen O
. O

The O
Spanish S-NORP
trains O
and O
the O
Istanbul S-GPE
bombings O
are O
only O
the O
beginning O
. O

The O
unity O
of O
the O
Civilized O

in O
fighting O
this O
horror O
is O
absolutely O
indispensable O

Until O
Europe S-LOC

this O

will O
not O
be O

It O
is O
often O
said O
that O
politicians O

diplomats O

perhaps O
also O
lawyers O

people O
must O
sometimes O
lie O

as O

But O
the O

are O
childish O

in O
comparison O
with O
the O
level O

which O
have O
reached O

war O
is O
an O
accepted O
tactic O
. O

But O
to O
stand O
, O
day O
after O
day O
, O
and O
to O
make O
such O
preposterous O
statements O
, O
known O
to O
everybody O
to O
be O
lies O
, O
without O
even O
being O
ridiculed O
in O
your O
own O
milieu O
, O
can O
only O
happen O
in O
this O
region O
. O

Mr. O
Sahaf S-PERSON
eventually O
became O
a O
popular O
icon O
as O
a O
court O
jester O
, O

but O
this O
did O
not O
stop O
some O
allegedly O
respectable O
newspapers O
from O
giving O
him O
equal O
time O
. O

It O
also O
does O
not O
prevent O
the O
Western O
press O
from O
giving O
credence O
, O
every O
day O
, O
even O
now O
, O
to O
similar O
liars O
. O

After O
all O
, O
if O
you O
want O
to O
be O
an O
anti-Semite O
, O
there O
are O
subtle O
ways O
of O
doing O
it O
. O

You O
do O
not O
have O
to O
claim O
that O
the O
holocaust S-EVENT
never O
happened O
, O
and O
that O
the O
Jewish S-NORP
temple O
in O
Jerusalem S-GPE
never O
existed O
. O

But O
millions S-CARDINAL
of O
Moslems S-NORP
are O
told O
by O
their O
leaders O
that O
this O
is O
the O
case O
. O

When O
these O
same O
leaders O
make O
other O
statements O
, O
the O
Western O
media O
report O
them O
as O
if O
they O
could O
be O
true O
. O

It O
is O
a O
daily O
occurrence O
that O
the O
same O
people O
who O
finance O
, O
arm O
and O
dispatch O
suicide O
murderers O
, O
condemn O
the O
act O
in O
English S-LANGUAGE
in O
front O
of O
western O
TV O
cameras O
, O
talking O
to O
a O
world O
audience O
, O
which O
even O
partly O
believes O
them O
. O

It O
is O
a O
daily O
routine O
to O
hear O
the O
same O
leader O
making O
opposite O
statements O
in O
Arabic S-LANGUAGE
to O
his O
people O
and O
in O
English S-LANGUAGE
to O
the O
rest O
of O
the O

Incitement O
by O
Arab S-NORP
TV O
, O
accompanied O
by O
horror O
pictures O
of O
mutilated O
bodies O
, O
has O
become O
a O
powerful O
weapon O
of O
those O
who O
lie O
, O
distort O
and O
want O
to O
destroy O
everything O
. O

Little O
children O
are O
raised O
on O
deep O
hatred O
and O
on O
admiration O
of O
so O
- O
called O
martyrs O
, O

and O
the O
Western O
World O
does O
not O
notice O
it O
because O
its O
own O
TV O
sets O
are O
mostly O
tuned O
to O
soap O
operas O
and O
game O
shows O
. O

I O
recommend O
to O
you O
, O
even O
though O
most O
of O
you O
do O
not O
understand O
Arabic S-LANGUAGE
, O
to O
watch O
Al B-ORG

from O
time O
to O
time O
. O

You O
will O
not O
believe O
your O
own O
eyes O

But O
words O
also O
work O
in O
other O
ways O
, O
more O
subtle O
. O

A O

and O
featuring O
three B-DATE

is O
defined O
by O
the O

by O
political O
leaders O
as O
a O
`` O

You O
may O

of O
Saddam S-PERSON

is O
a O

A O
woman O
walks O
into O
an O
Israeli S-NORP
restaurant O
in O
mid-day O
, O
eats O
, O
observes O
families O
with O
old O
people O
and O
children O
eating O
their O
lunch O
in O
the O
adjacent O
tables O
and O
pays O
the O
bill O
. O

She O
then O
blows O
herself O
up O
, O
killing O
20 S-CARDINAL
people O
, O
including O
many O
children O
, O
with O
heads O
and O
arms O
rolling O
around O
in O
the O
restaurant O

She O
is O
called O
`` O
martyr O
'' O
by O
several O
Arab S-NORP
leaders O
and O
`` O
activist O
'' O
by O
the O
European S-NORP

Dignitaries O
condemn O
the O
act O
but O
visit O
her O
bereaved O
family O
and O
the O
money O

There O
is O
a O
new O
game O
in O
town O
: O

The O
actual O
murderer O
is O
called O
`` O
the O
military O
wing O

, O

the O
one O
who O
pays O
him O
, O
equips O
him O
and O
sends O
him O
is O
now O
called O
`` O
the O
political O
wing O
'' O

and O
the O
head O
of O
the O
operation O
is O
called O
the O
`` O
spiritual O
leader O
'' O
. O

There O
are O
numerous O
other O
examples O
of O
such O
Orwellian O
nomenclature O
, O
used O
every O
day O
not O
only O
by O
terror O
chiefs O
but O
also O
by O
Western O
media O
. O

These O
words O
are O
much O
more O
dangerous O
than O
many O
people O
realize O
. O

They O
provide O
an O
emotional O
infrastructure O
for O
atrocities O

It O
was O
Joseph B-PERSON

Huge O
amounts O
of O
money O
, O
which O
could O
have O
solved O
many O
social O
problems O
in O
this O
dysfunctional O
part O
of O
the O
world O
, O
are O
channeled O
into O
three S-CARDINAL
concentric O
spheres O
supporting O
death O
and O
murder O
. O

In O
the O
inner O
circle O
are O
the O
terrorists O
themselves O
. O

The O
money O
funds O
their O
travel O
, O
explosives O
, O
hideouts O
and O
permanent O
search O
for O
soft O
vulnerable O
targets O
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
are O
primarily O
financed O
by O
terrorist O
states O
like O
Iran S-GPE
and O
Syria S-GPE
, O
until O
recently O
also O
by O
Iraq S-GPE
and O
Libya S-GPE
and O
earlier O
also O
by O
some O
of O
the O
Communist S-NORP
regimes O
. O

These O
states O
, O
as O
well O
as O
the B-ORG
Palestinian I-ORG
Authority E-ORG
, O
are O
the O
safe O
havens O
of O
the O
wholesale O
murder O
vendors O
. O

They O
are O
surrounded O
by O
a O
second S-ORDINAL
wider O
circle O
of O
direct O
supporters O
, O
planners O
, O
commanders O
, O
preachers O
, O
all O
of O
whom O
make O
a O
living O
, O
usually O
a O
very O
comfortable O
living O
, O
by O
serving O
as O
terror O
infrastructure O
. O

Finally O
, O
we O
find O
the O
third S-ORDINAL
circle O
of O
so O
- O
called O
religious O
, O
educational O
and O
welfare O
organizations O
, O
which O
actually O
do O
some O
good O
, O
feed O
the O
hungry O
and O
provide O
some O
schooling O
, O
but O
brainwash O
a O
new O
generation O
with O
hatred O
, O
lies O
and O
ignorance O
. O

This O
circle O
operates O
mostly O
through O
mosques O
, O
madrasas O
and O
other O
religious O
establishments O
but O
also O
through O
inciting O
electronic O
and O
printed O
media O
. O

It O
is O
this O
circle O
that O
makes O
sure O
that O
women O
remain O
inferior O
, O
that O
democracy O
is O
unthinkable O
and O
that O
exposure O
to O
the O
outside O
world O
is O
minimal O
. O

It O
is O
also O
that O
circle O
that O
leads O
the O
way O
in O
blaming O
everybody O
outside O
the O
Moslem S-NORP
world O
, O
for O
the O
miseries O
of O
the O
region O
. O

The O
outer O
circle O
is O
largely O
financed O
by O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia E-GPE
, O
but O
also O
by O
donations O
from O
certain O
Moslem S-NORP
communities O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States E-GPE
and O
Europe S-LOC

, O
to O
a O
smaller O
extent O

by O
donations O
of O
European S-NORP
Governments O
to O
various O
NGO's O
and O
by O
certain O
United B-ORG
Nations E-ORG
organizations O
, O
whose O
goals O
may O
be O
noble O
, O
but O
they O
are O
infested O
and O
exploited O
by O
agents O
of O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

The O
Saudi S-NORP
regime O
, O
of O
course O
, O
will O
be O
the O
next O
victim O
of O
major O
terror O
, O
when O
the O
inner O
circle O
will O
explode O
into O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

The O
Saudis S-NORP
are O
beginning O
to O
understand O
it O
, O
but O
they O
fight O
the O
inner O
circles O
, O
while O
still O
financing O
the O
infrastructure O
at O
the O
outer O
circle O
. O

Figuratively O
speaking O
, O
this O
outer O
circle O
is O
the O
guardian O
, O
which O
makes O
sure O
that O
the O
people O
look O
and O
listen O
inwards O
to O
the O
inner O
circle O
of O
terror O
and O
incitement O
, O
rather O
than O
to O
the O
world O
outside O
. O

Some O
parts O
of O
this O
same O
outer O
circle O
actually O
operate O
as O
a O
result O
of O
fear O
from O
, O
or O
blackmail O
by O
, O
the O
inner O
circles O
. O

The O
horrifying O
added O
factor O
is O
the O
high O
birth O
rate O

Half S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
population O
of O

most O

how O

winning O

Other O
aspects O

have O
limitations O

Can O
a O

are O
the O
old O

dilemmas O

But O
now O
we O
have O
an O
entire O
new O
set O

Do O
you O

ammunition O

Do O
you O

Do O
you O
storm O
a O

Do O
you O

Do O

Do O

Do O
you O

What O
do O

you O

the O
dilemma O

it O
can O

Suppose O
, O
for O
the O
sake O
of O

that O
someone O
would O
openly O
stay O

a O
well O

known O
address O
in O

it O
, O
executing O

another O
in O

killing O

crimes O
, O
promising O

condemnations O

treat O

I O
leave O
it O
to O
you O
as O
homework O
to O
figur O
out O
what O
Spain S-GPE
or O
France S-GPE
would O
have O
done O
, O
in O
such O
a O
situation O
. O

The O
problem O
is O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
is O
still O
having O
illusions O
about O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
in O
a O
totally O
lawless O
environment O
. O

It O
is O
trying O
to O
play O
ice O
hockey O
by O
sending O
a O
ballerina O
ice O
- O
skater O
into O
the O
ring O
or O
to O
knock O
out O
a O
heavyweight O
boxer O
by O
a O
chess O
player O
. O

In O
the O
same O
way O
that O
no O
country O
has O
a O
law O
against O
cannibals O
eating O
its O
prime O
minister O
, O
because O
such O
an O
act O
is O
unthinkable O
, O
international O
law O
does O
not O
address O
killers O
shooting O
from O
hospitals O
, O
mosques O
and O
ambulances O
, O
while O
being O
protected O
by O
their O
Government O
or O
society O
. O

International O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
handle O
someone O
who O
sends O
children O
to O
throw O
stones O
, O
stands O
behind O
them O
and O
shoots O
with O
immunity O
and O
can O
not O
be O
arrested O
because O
he O
is O
sheltered O
by O
a O
Government O
. O

International O
law O
does O
not O
know O
how O
to O
deal O
with O
a O
leader O
of O
murderers O
who O
is O
royally O
and O
comfortably O
hosted O
by O
a O
country O
, O
which O
pretends O
to O
condemn O
his O
acts O
or O
just O
claims O
to O
be O
too O
weak O
to O
arrest O
him O
. O

The O
amazing O
thing O
is O
that O
all O
of O
these O
crooks O
demand O
protection O
under O
international O
law O
, O
and O
define O
all O
those O
who O
attack O
them O
as O
`` O
war O
criminals O
, O
'' O
with O
some O
Western O
media O
repeating O
the O
allegations O
. O

The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
all O
of O
this O
is O
temporary O
, O

because O
the O
evolution O
of O
international O
law O
has O
always O
adapted O
itself O
to O
reality O
. O

The O
punishment O
for O
suicide O
murder O
should O
be O
death O
or O
arrest O
before O
the O
murder O
, O
not O
during O
and O
not O
after O

After O
every O
world O
war O
, O
the O
rules O
of O
international O
law O
have O
changed O
, O
and O
the O
same O
will O
happen O
after O
the O
present O
one O
. O

But O
during O
the O
twilight O
zone O
, O
a O
lot O
of O
harm O
can O
be O
done O
. O

The O
picture O
I O
described O
here O
is O
not O
pretty O
. O

What O
can O
we O
do O
about O
it O
? O

In O
the O
short O
run O
, O
only O
fight O
and O
win O
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
only O
educate O
the O
next O
generation O
and O
open O
it O
to O
the O
world O
. O

The O
inner O
circles O
can O
and O
must O
be O
destroyed O
by O
force O
. O

The O
outer O
circle O
can O
not O
be O
eliminated O
by O
force O
. O

Here O
we O
need O
financial O
starvation O
of O
the O
organizing O
elite O
, O
more O
power O
to O
women O
, O
more O
education O
, O
counter-propaganda O
, O
boycott O
whenever O
feasible O
and O
access O
to O
Western O
media O
, O
internet O
and O
the O
international O
scene O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
we O
need O
a O
total O
absolute O
unity O
and O
determination O
of O
the O
civilized O
world O
against O
all O
three S-CARDINAL
circles O
of O
evil O
. O

Allow O
me O
, O
for O
a O
moment O
, O
to O
depart O
from O
my O
alleged O
role O
as O
a O
taxi O
driver O
and O
return O
to O
science O
. O

When O
you O
have O
a O
malignant O
tumor O
, O
you O
may O
remove O
the O
tumor O
itself O
surgically O
. O

You O
may O
also O
starve O
it O
by O
preventing O
new O
blood O
from O
reaching O
it O
from O
other O
parts O
of O
the O
body O
, O
thereby O
preventing O
new O
`` O
supplies O
'' O
from O
expanding O
the O
tumor O
. O

If O
you O
want O
to O
be O
sure O
, O
it O
is O
best O
to O
do O
both O
. O

But O
before O
you O
fight O
and O
win O
, O
by O
force O
or O
otherwise O
, O
you O
have O
to O
realize O
that O
you O
are O
in O
a O
war O
, O
and O
this O
may O
take O
Europe S-LOC
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
more I-DATE
years E-DATE
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
, O
it O
is O
necessary O
to O
first S-ORDINAL
eliminate O
the O
terrorist O
regimes O
, O
so O
that O
no O
Government O
in O
the O
world O
will O
serve O
as O
a O
safe O
haven O
for O
these O
people O
. O

I O
do O
not O
want O
to O
comment O
here O
on O
whether O
the O
American S-NORP
- O
led O
attack O
on O
Iraq S-GPE
was O
justified O
from O
the O
point O
of O
view O
of O
weapons O
of O
mass O
destruction O
or O
any O
other O
pre-war O
argument O
, O
but O
I O
can O
look O
at O
the O
post-war O
map O
of O
Western B-LOC
Asia E-LOC
. O

Now O
that O
Afghanistan S-GPE
, O
Iraq S-GPE
and O
Libya S-GPE
are O
out O
, O
two B-CARDINAL
and I-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
half E-CARDINAL
terrorist O
states O
remain O
: O
Iran S-GPE
, O
Syria S-GPE
and O
Lebanon S-GPE
, O
the O
latter O
being O
a O
Syrian S-NORP
colony O
. O

Perhaps O
Sudan S-GPE
should O
be O
added O
to O
the O
list O
. O

As O
a O
result O
of O
the O
conquest O
of O
Afghanistan S-GPE
and O
Iraq S-GPE
, O
both O
Iran S-GPE
and O
Syria S-GPE
are O
now O
totally O
surrounded O
by O
territories O
unfriendly O
to O
them O
. O

Iran S-GPE
is O
encircled O
by O
Afghanistan S-GPE
, O
by O
the B-GPE
Gulf I-GPE
States E-GPE
, O
Iraq S-GPE
and O
the O
Moslem S-NORP
republics O
of O
the O
former O
Soviet B-GPE
Union E-GPE
. O

Syria S-GPE
is O
surrounded O
by O
Turkey S-GPE
, O
Iraq S-GPE
, O
Jordan S-GPE
and O
Israel S-GPE
. O

This O
is O
a O
significant O
strategic O
change O
and O
it O
applies O
strong O
pressure O
on O
the O
terrorist O
countries O
. O

It O
is O
not O
surprising O
that O
Iran S-GPE
is O
so O
active O
in O
trying O
to O
incite O
a O
Shiite S-NORP
uprising O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

I O
do O
not O
know O
if O
the O
American S-NORP
plan O
was O
actually O
to O
encircle O
both O
Iran S-GPE
and O
Syria S-GPE
, O
but O
that O
is O
the O
resulting O
situation O
. O

In O
my O
humble O
opinion O
, O
the O
number O
one S-CARDINAL
danger O
to O
the O
world O
today O
is O
Iran S-GPE
and O
its O
regime O
. O

It O
definitely O
has O
ambitions O
to O
rule O
vast O
areas O
and O
to O
expand O
in O
all O
directions O
. O

It O
has O
an O
ideology O
which O
claims O
supremacy O
over O
Western O
culture O
. O

It O
is O
ruthless O
. O

It O
has O
proven O
that O
it O
can O
execute O
elaborate O
terrorist O
acts O
without O
leaving O
too O
many O
traces O
, O
using O
Iranian S-NORP
Embassies O
. O

It O
is O
clearly O
trying O
to O
develop O
nuclear O
weapons O
. O

Its O
so O
- O
called O
moderates O
and O
conservatives O
play O
their O
own O
virtuoso O
version O
of O
the O
`` O
good O
- O
cop O
versus O
bad O
- O
cop O
'' O
game O
. O



Iran S-GPE
sponsors O
Syrian S-NORP
terrorism O
, O

it O
is O
certainly O
behind O
much O
of O
the O
action O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
, O

it O
is O
fully O
funding O
the O
Hezbollah S-ORG
and O
, O
through O
it O
, O
the O
Palestinian S-NORP
Hamas S-ORG
and O
Islamic B-ORG
Jihad E-ORG
; O

it O
performed O
acts O
of O
terror O
at O
least O
in O
Europe S-LOC
and O
in O
South B-LOC
America E-LOC
and O
probably O
also O
in O
Uzbekistan S-GPE
and O
Saudi B-GPE
Arabia E-GPE

and O
it O
truly O
leads O
a O
multi-national O
terror O
consortium O
, O
which O
includes O
, O
as O
minor O
players O
, O
Syria S-GPE
, O
Lebanon S-GPE
and O
certain O
Shiite S-NORP
elements O
in O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
most O
European S-NORP
countries O
still O
trade O
with O
Iran S-GPE
, O
try O
to O
appease O
it O
and O
refuse O
to O
read O
the O
clear O
signals O
. O

In O
order O
to O
win O
the O
war O
it O
is O
also O
necessary O
to O
dry O
the O
financial O
resources O
of O
the O
terror O
conglomerate O
. O

It O
is O
pointless O
to O
try O
to O
understand O
the O
subtle O
differences O
between O
the O
Sunni S-NORP
terror O
of O
Al B-ORG
Qaeda E-ORG
and O
Hamas S-ORG
and O
the O
Shiite S-NORP
terror O
of O
Hezbollah S-ORG
, O
Sadr S-ORG
and O
other O
Iranian S-NORP
- O
inspired O
enterprises O
. O

When O
it O
serves O
their O
business O
needs O
, O
all O
of O
them O
collaborate O
beautifully O
. O

It O
is O
crucial O
to O
stop O
Saudi S-NORP
and O
other O
financial O
support O
of O
the O
outer O
circle O
, O
which O
is O
the O
fertile O
breeding O
ground O
of O
terror O
. O

It O
is O
important O
to O
monitor O
all O
donations O
from O
the O
Western O
World O
to O
Islamic S-NORP
organizations O
, O
to O
monitor O
the O
finances O
of O
international O
relief O
organizations O
and O
to O
react O
with O
forceful O
economic O
measures O
to O
any O
small O
sign O
of O
financial O
aid O
to O
any O
of O
the O
three O
circles O
of O
terrorism O
. O

It O
is O
also O
important O
to O
act O
decisively O
against O
the O
campaign O
of O
lies O
and O
fabrications O
and O
to O
monitor O
those O
Western O
media O
who O
collaborate O
with O
it O
out O
of O
naivety O
, O
financial O
interests O
or O
ignorance O
. O

Above O
all O
, O
never O
surrender O
to O
terror O
. O

No O
one O
will O
ever O
know O
whether O
the O
recent O
elections O
in O
Spain S-GPE
would O
have O
yielded O
a O
different O
result O
, O
if O
not O
for O
the O
train O
bombings O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days I-DATE
earlier E-DATE
. O

But O
it O
really O
does O
not O
matter O
. O

What O
matters O
is O
that O
the O
terrorists O
believe O
that O
they O
caused O
the O
result O
and O
that O
they O
won O
by O
driving O
Spain S-GPE
out O
of O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

The O
Spanish S-NORP
story O
will O
surely O
end O
up O
being O
extremely O
costly O
to O
other O
European S-NORP
countries O
, O
including O
France S-GPE
, O
who O
is O
now O
expelling O
inciting O
preachers O
and O
forbidding O
veils O
and O
including O
others O
who O
sent O
troops O
to O
Iraq S-GPE
. O

In O
the O
long O
run O
, O
Spain S-GPE
itself O
will O
pay O
even O
more O
. O

Is O
the O
solution O
a O
democratic O
Arab S-NORP
world O
? O

If O
by O
democracy O
we O
mean O
free O
elections O
but O
also O
free O
press O
, O
free O
speech O
, O
a O
functioning O
judicial O
system O
, O
civil O
liberties O
, O
equality O
to O
women O
, O
free O
international O
travel O
, O
exposure O
to O
international O
media O
and O
ideas O
, O
laws O
against O
racial O
incitement O
and O
against O
defamation O
, O
and O
avoidance O
of O
lawless O
behavior O
regarding O
hospitals O
, O
places O
of O
worship O
and O
children O
, O
then O
yes O
, O
democracy O
is O
the O
solution O
. O

If O
democracy O
is O
just O
free O
elections O
, O
it O
is O
likely O
that O
the O
most O
fanatic O
regime O
will O
be O
elected O
, O
the O
one O
whose O
incitement O
and O
fabrications O
are O
the O
most O
inflammatory O
. O

We O
have O
seen O
it O
already O
in O
Algeria S-GPE
and O
, O
to O
a O
certain O
extent O
, O
in O
Turkey S-GPE
. O

It O
will O
happen O
again O
, O
if O
the O
ground O
is O
not O
prepared O
very O
carefully O
. O

On O
the O
other O
hand O
, O
a O
certain O
transition O
democracy O
, O
as O
in O
Jordan S-GPE
, O
may O
be O
a O
better O
temporary O
solution O
, O
paving O
the O
way O
for O
the O
real O
thing O
, O
perhaps O
in O
the O
same O
way O
that O
an O
immediate O
sudden O
democracy O
did O
not O
work O
in O
Russia S-GPE
and O
would O
not O
have O
worked O
in O
China S-GPE
. O

I O
have O
no O
doubt O
that O
the O
civilized O
world O
will O
prevail O
. O

But O
the O
longer O
it O
takes O
us O
to O
understand O
the O
new O
landscape O
of O
this O
war O
, O
the O
more O
costly O
and O
painful O
the O
victory O
will O
be O
. O

Its O
understandable O
recoil O
from O

, O
following O

may O

rather O
, O
Haditha S-EVENT

these O

Haditha S-EVENT
is O
n't O
Abu B-GPE
Sifa E-GPE
where O
, O
according O
to O
Iraqi S-NORP
police O
, O
US S-NORP
forces O
'' O
on O
a O
rampage O

executed O
a O

11 S-CARDINAL

then O
bombed O
their O

What O

we O

Abu B-EVENT

now O
Haditha S-EVENT
has O
become O
the O
representative O

inevitable O
example O

Because O
along O

Jesse B-PERSON

whose O
claims O
that O

was O
method O
rather O

rapidly O
went O
viral O
on O

His O
story O
was O
unsubstantiated O

exteme O

plausible O
because O
it O
was O

and O
provided O
a O

the O

A O
pattern O
rarely O

But O
Macbeth S-PERSON

it O

is O
the O
Pentagon S-ORG

buttress O

it O

a O
concept O

`` O

That O

a O

that O

In O

it O
may O
be O
that O

harden O
the O

to O
the O

that O
it O
really O

News O
reports O
inform O
us O
that O
American S-NORP
military O
officials O
are O
now O
convinced O
that O
a O
unit O
of O
Marines S-NORP
killed O
some O
24 S-CARDINAL
unarmed O
Iraqis S-NORP
, O
including O
women O
and O
six S-CARDINAL
children O
. O

Some O
of O
the O
victims O
had O
been O
shot O
`` O
execution O
style O
. O
'' O

One S-CARDINAL
government O
official O
stated O
that O
this O
atrocity O
showed O
`` O
a O
total O
breakdown O
in O
morality O
. O
'' O

What O
on O
earth O
do O
these O
officials O
think O
all O
war O
is O
, O
if O
not O
a O
`` O
breakdown O
in O

? O
'' O

If O
the O
systematic O
slaughter O
of O
tens B-CARDINAL
or I-CARDINAL
hundreds I-CARDINAL
of I-CARDINAL
thousands E-CARDINAL
of O
human O
beings O
does O
n't O
represent O
a O
`` O

, O
'' O
what O
does O
? O

Do O
we O
have O
to O
wait O
for O
some O
major O
offense O
, O
such O
as O
illicit O
sex O
in O
the B-FAC
oval I-FAC
office E-FAC
? O

I O
would O
go O
even O
further O
than O
this O
: O

`` O
war O
is O
the O
mobilization O
of O
immorality O
. O
'' O

Would O
these O
apologists O
for O
such O
killings O
have O
been O
satisfied O
if O
the O
same O
deaths O
to O
the O
same O
innocents O
had O
been O
brought O
about O
by O
aerial O
bombs O
? O

I O
am O
reminded O
of O
a O
distinction O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
my O
students O
tried O
making O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
years I-DATE
ago E-DATE
in O
contrasting O
suicide O
bombers O
with O
militarily O
disciplined O
killing O
: O

`` O
at O
least O
we O
have O
the O
decency O
to O
drop O
bombs O
from O

, O
'' O
he O
declared O
. O

I O
wonder O
what O
kind O
of O
spin O
the O
twits O
at O
Faux B-ORG
News E-ORG
are O
putting O
on O
this O
for O
their O
audience O
of O
the O
bloodthirsty O
! O

On O
this O
Memorial B-DATE
Day E-DATE
weekend O
, O
it O
would O
be O
worthwhile O
for O
Americans S-NORP
- O
whose O
government O
is O
running O
this O
abattoir O
- O
to O
recognize O
the O
immorality O
of O
their O
support O
for O
such O
madness O
. O

Those O
who O
wave O
their O
flags O
, O
or O
emblazon O
their O
cars O
with O
`` O

are O
as O
much O
to O
blame O
for O
this O
so O
- O
called O
`` O
breakdown O
in O
morality O
'' O
as O
anyone O
else O
. O

Out O
of O
a O
sense O
of O
moral O
decency O
, O
this O
weekend O
might O
be O
an O
appropriate O
occasion O
to O
remove O
such O
symbols O
from O
their O
cars O
, O
homes O
, O
and O
- O
better O
yet O
- O
their O
minds O

did O
U.S. S-NORP

their O

For O
the O
Chinese S-NORP
Communists S-NORP
killing O

also O
necessary O
for O
practical O
reasons O

The O
Communist S-NORP
Party O
began O
as O
a O
group O
of O
thugs O
and O
scoundrels O
who O
killed O
to O
obtain O
power O
. O

Once O
this O
precedent O
was O
set O
, O
there O
was O
no O
going O
back O

Constant O
terror O
was O
needed O
to O
intimidate O

out O

In O
a O
normal O
society O
, O
people O
show O
care O
and O
love O
for O
one O
another O
, O
hold O
life O
in O
awe O
and O
veneration O
and O
give O
thanks O
to O
God O
. O

In O
the O
East S-LOC
, O
people O
say O
, O
`` O
Do O
not O

what O
you O
would O
not O
want O

to O
yourself O

In O
the O
West S-LOC
, O
people O
say O
, O
`` O
Love O
thy O
neighbor O
as O
thyself O
. O
'' O

Conversely O
, O
the O
CCP S-ORG
holds O
that O
`` O
The O
history O
of O
all O
hitherto O
existing O
society O
is O
the O
history O
of O

'' O

In O
order O
to O
keep O
alive O
the O
`` O
struggles O
'' O
within O
society O
, O
hatred O
must O
be O
generated O
. O

Not O
only O
does O
the O
CCP S-ORG
take O
lives O
, O
it O
encourages O
people O
to O
kill O
each O
other O
. O

It O
strives O
to O
desensitize O
people O
towards O
others O
' O
suffering O
by O
surrounding O
them O
with O
constant O
killing O
. O

It O
wants O
them O
to O
become O
numb O
from O
frequent O
exposure O
to O
inhumane O
brutality O
, O
and O
develop O
the O
mentality O
that O
`` O
the O
best O
you O
can O
hope O
for O
is O
to O
avoid O
being O
persecuted O
. O
'' O



All O
these O
lessons O
taught O
by O
brutal O
suppression O
enable O
the O
CCP S-ORG
to O
maintain O
its O
rule O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
destruction O
of O
countless O
lives O
, O
the O
CCP S-ORG
also O
destroyed O
the O
soul O
of O
the O
Chinese S-NORP
people O
. O

A O
great O
many O
people O
have O
become O
conditioned O
to O
react O
to O
the O
CCP S-ORG
's O
threats O
by O
entirely O
surrendering O
their O
reason O
and O
their O
principles O
. O

In O
a O
sense O
, O
these O
people O

have O
died O

something O
more O

than O
physical O

According O
to O
Kathy B-PERSON
Griggs E-PERSON
, O
this O
revolutionary O

is O
controlling O
the O
Marines S-ORG

They O
all O
operate O
together O

They O
actually O
promoted O
communists S-NORP
in O
the O
OSS S-ORG

which O
was O
started O
by O
William B-PERSON

So O
they O
promote O

who O
actually O
want O
to O
get O

the O
form O

a O

After O

So O

The O

if O
dumb O

Americans S-NORP
did O
not O
want O

Except O
very O

And O
, O
you O

horrible O

that O
dozens S-CARDINAL

maybe O
hundreds S-CARDINAL
of O
civilians O
were O
murdered O
in O
cold O

by O
US S-NORP

And O
this O
is O
a O

Wake O
up O

Ever O

-LRB- O

the O

and O
the O

b*llshit O
such O

Please O
, O
people O
, O
there O
is O
no O

here O
: O
just O
a O

, O
realizing O
they O
have O
unleashed O
horror O
on O
innocents O
and O
trying O
to O
cover O
their O
asses O
. O

Why O
do O
you O
think O
only O
lowly O
soldiers O
and O
no O
generals O
have O
been O
convicted O
? O

Because O
generals O
have O
the O
power O
, O
that O
's O
why O
! O

So O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
soldier O
stood O
up O
and O
talked O
about O
some O
razed O
shithole O
in O
Iraq O
? O

Maybe O
he O
is O
going O
overboard O
and O
creating O
a O
fancy O
tale O
of O
horror O
? O

So O
what O
? O

That O
's O
not O
a O
cover O

up O

that O
's O
just O
some O
dumb O

white O

making O

up O

Of O

the O

Nothing O

In O
WWII S-EVENT

most O

either O

DA S-PERSON
: O
speaking O
of O
`` O

is O
employing O
the O

, O
yes O

Is O
a O

in O

terribly O
different O
from O
a O

shithole O
in O

say O
, O
Waco S-GPE
, O

? O

Please O
do O
n't O
forget O
that O
the O

never O

anything O

us O

We O

`` O

In O
your O
little O
history O
lesson O
-LRB- O
why O
not O
go O
back O
to O
the O
Romans S-NORP
who O
slaughtered O
everyone O
in O
Carthage S-GPE
, O
or O
, O
for O
that O
matter O
, O
the O
Israelites S-NORP
in O
the O
OT S-WORK_OF_ART
, O
commanded O
by O
Yawheh O
to O
slaughter O
man O
, O
women O
, O
and O
child O
? O
-RRB- O
, O
you O
mention O
the O
bombing O
of O
Dresden S-GPE
. O

I O
'll O
toss O
in O
Hiroshima S-EVENT
and O
Nagasaki S-EVENT
, O

but O
those O
pilot O
- O
murderers O
were O
at O
one S-CARDINAL
remove O
from O
the O
slaughter O
they O
were O
, O
uh O
, O
enabling O
: O

they O
did O
n't O
have O
to O
look O
at O
the O
mother O
trying O
to O
shield O
her O
kids O
before O
pulling O
the O
trigger O
. O

Obviously O
, O
the O
pilots O
did O
n't O
think O
too O
much O
about O
what O
was O
happening O
on O
the O
ground O
, O
or O
they O
would O
lose O
their O
minds O
-LRB- O
their O
souls O
had O
already O
been O
burned O
away O
, O
whether O
they O
knew O
it O
or O
not O
-RRB- O
. O

I O
'm O
sure O
there O
were O
GIs O
shooting O
innocents O
in O
WW2 S-EVENT
, O

but O
that O
kind O
of O
atrocity O
is O
not O
emblamatic O
of O
the O
war O
, O
in O
the O
way O
that O
napalm O
drops O
and O
tiger O
teams O
are O
emblamatic O
of O
Vietnam S-EVENT
, O
and O
Fallujah S-EVENT
and O
Abu B-EVENT

will O
be O
emblamatic O

. O

Denying O
the O
effects O
of O

is O
denying O
the O
effects O
of O
operant O

. O

Yes O
, O
at O
the O
root O
of O
our O
monstrous O
age O
is O
the O
loss O
of O
any O
sense O
of O
the O
sacred O
, O
or O
, O
more O
specifically O
, O
the O
acute O
sense O
that O
humans O
are O
created O
in O
the O
image O
of O
God O
and O
that O
God O
is O
very O
much O
real O
and O
keeping O

, O

but O
surely O
one S-CARDINAL
step O
towards O
rediscovering O
human O
dignity O
is O
acknowledging O
that O

. O

No O
one O

Let O
's O
talk O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
about O
what O
the O
Navy S-ORG
does O
to O
prevent O
such O
tragedies O
. O

We O
were O
talking O
about O
it O
this B-TIME
morning E-TIME
and O
we O
put O
together O
some O
graphics O
for O
you O
. O

I O
'll O
try O
to O
explain O
it O
the O
best O
I O
can O
from O
what O
I O
remember O
from O
being O
on O
the B-PRODUCT
`` I-PRODUCT
USS I-PRODUCT
Abraham I-PRODUCT
Lincoln I-PRODUCT
'' E-PRODUCT
. O

This O
is O
an O
amphibious O
ship O
, O
rather O
, O
but O
this O
is O
what O
the O
Navy S-ORG
does O
with O
regard O
to O
prevention O
. O

, O
every O
sailor O
that O
's O
entering O
the O
Navy S-ORG
does O
take O
a O
swim O
test O
. O

They O
learn O
how O
to O
tread O
water O
and O
do O
the O
dead O
man O
float O
and O
they O
have O
to O
pass O
that O
in O
order O
to O
continue O
on O
. O

Also O
drills O
take O
place O
before O
sailors O
get O
on O
to O
any O
ship O
, O
before O
any O
deployment O
. O

Usually O
twice O
a O
day O
, O
they O
're O
practicing O
man O
overboard O
drills O
, O
knowing O
where O
to O
go O
, O
where O
to O
report O
to O
if O
indeed O
a O
man O
overboard O
takes O
place O
and O
as O
the O
deployment O
begins O
, O
those O
wane O
off O
, O
but O
they O
know O
where O
to O
go O
quickly O
. O

They O
also O
wear O
float O
coats O
. O

You O
can O
see O
them O
here O
. O

The O
yellow O
shirt O
is O
wearing O
a O
yellow O
float O
coat O
. O

Everything O
is O
color O
coordinated O
. O

You O
see O
the O
gentleman O
here O
wearing O
a O
brown O
one O
and O
they O
have O
toggles O
to O
pull O
and O
inflate O
. O

They O
also O
have O
a O
manual O
device O
so O
if O
the O
toggles O
do O
n't O
work O
they O
can O
blow O
air O
into O
the O
inflation O
device O
. O

They O
have O
dive O
goggles O
and O
they O
're O
able O
to O
find O
them O
. O

It O
also O
has O
a O
strobe O
light O
and O
a O
whistle O
. O

Also O
such O
location O
devices O
, O
some O
ships O
have O
smoke O
floats O
they O
can O
toss O
out O
so O
the O
man O
overboard O
will O
be O
able O
to O
use O
smoke O
signals O
as O
a O
way O
of O
trying O
to O
, O
let O
the O
rescuer O
locate O
them O
. O

Also O
24 S-CARDINAL
/ O
7 O
there O
are O
individuals O
on O
watch O
, O
all O
throughout O
the O
ship O
, O
all O
around O
the O
ship O
, O
and O
indeed O
, O
there O
is O
netting O
on O
most O
parts O
of O
the O
ship O
, O
not O
all O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
but O
on O
most O
parts O
there O
is O
a O
very O
thick O
netting O
. O

Now O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
the O
man O
overboard O
rescue O
and O
when O
indeed O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
situation O
. O

You O
will O
hear O
a O
P.A. O
announcement O
around O
the O
entire O
ship O
, O
there O
is O
a O
man O
overboard O
so O
everyone O
knows O
they O
have O
to O
react O
quickly O
. O

A O
ship O
- O
wide O
search O
will O
happen O
if O
they O
do O
n't O
see O
that O
person O
go O
overboard O
, O
but O
if O
indeed O
they O
do O
see O
someone O
go O
overboard O
, O
the O
ship O
starts O
to O
circle O
that O
area O
continuously O
. O

Also O
small O
boats O
sometimes O
go O
out O
into O
the O
water O
, O
but O
even O
more O
importantly O
, O
helicopters O
are O
launched O
immediately O
. O

Inside O
those O
helicopters O
rescue O
swimmers O
. O

If O
indeed O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
located O
, O
well O
the O
hoister O
is O
dropped O
down O
with O
usually O
a O
torso O
harness O
. O

If O
the O
man O
overboard O
is O
injured O
then O
they O
may O
use O
a O
basket O
, O
but O
more O
than O
likely O
those O
swimmers O
will O
go O
right O
into O
the O
water O
and O
try O
and O
help O
the O
swimmer O
hook O
up O
on O
that O
harness O
and O
pull O
them O
up O
into O
the O
helo O
and O
pull O
them O
back O
on O
to O
the O
ship O
for O
treatment O
and O
usually O
a O
search O
takes O
about B-TIME
24 I-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O

The O
search O
crews O
will O
go O
24 B-TIME
hours E-TIME
before O
calling O
off O
that O
search O
. O

Why O
call O
it O
off O
? O

There O
's O
a O
number O
of O
reasons O
to O
look O
at O
. O

Depending O
on O
the O
water O
temperature O
, O
it O
's O
very O
common O
in O
cold O
water O
that O
someone O
will O
not O
survive O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
time O
. O

Also O
the O
reason O
for O
the O
24 B-TIME
- I-TIME
hour E-TIME
search O
is O
they O
fail O
they O
've O
exhausted O
all O
resources O
by O
that O
time O
. O

Anyway O
, O
we O
'll O
continue O
to O
follow O
what O
's O
happening O
on O
the B-PRODUCT
`` I-PRODUCT
USS I-PRODUCT

Originally O
the B-ORG
Central I-ORG
Command E-ORG
said O
the O
veteran O
Fox B-ORG

correspond O
was O
being O
expelled O
because O
he O
compromised O
the O
location O
of O
the O

Now O
a O
spokesman O
from O
the B-ORG
Central I-ORG
Command E-ORG
is O
saying O
and O
I O
'm O
quoting O
`` O
Frankly O
, O
we O
have O
bigger O

more O
important O
things O

'' O

During O
a O

Says O
he O
's O
not O
aware O
he O
's O
being O
expelled O
but O
says O
if O
so O
, O
it O
is O
because O
some O
bitter O
former O
colleagues O
of O
his O
at O
MSNBC S-ORG
blew O
the O
whistle O
on O
him O
. O

It O
sounds O
to O
me O
like O
some O
rats O
at O
my O
former O

NBC S-ORG
, O
are O
spreading O
some O

me O
. O

You O
know O
, O
they O
ca O
n't O
compete O
fair O

they O
're O
trying O

It O
is O
not O
first O
time O
. O

The B-ORG
Central I-ORG
Command E-ORG
on O
the O
other O
hand O
says O

is O

out O

because O
`` O
he O
gave O
away O
the O
big O

'' O

All O
of O
this O
now O
under O
review O
, O
whether O
or O
not O
Geraldo S-PERSON
stays O
or O
goes O
. O

We O
'll O
continue O
to O
monitor O
that O
front O
on O

yix O
another O

is O
being O
fired O

his O

NBC S-ORG

We O
showed O
you O
the O
statements O
yesterday S-DATE

He O
said O
the O
coalition O

first S-ORDINAL
war O
plan O
had O
failed O
because O
of O
Iraqi S-NORP
resistance O
. O

Today S-DATE
he O
appeared O
on O
NBC S-ORG
's O
`` O
Today S-WORK_OF_ART

show O
and O
said O
he O
was O
sorry O
. O

I O
want O
to O
apologize O
to O
the O
American S-NORP
people O
for O
clearly O
making O
a O
misjudgment O
over O
the B-DATE
weekend E-DATE
by O
giving O
an O
interview O
to O
Iraqi S-NORP
television O
. O

Now O
, O
I O
said O
in O
that O
interview O
essentially O
what O
we O
all O
know O
about O
the O
war O
, O
there O
have O
been O
delays O
in O

policy O
, O
there O
has O
been O
surprises O
, O
but O
clearly O
by O
giving O
that O
interview O
to O
Iraqi S-NORP
television O
, O
I O
created O
a O
firestorm O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States E-GPE
, O
and O
for O
that O
I O
am O
truly O
sorry O
. O

Arnett S-PERSON
had O
been O
covering O
the O
war O
for O
National B-ORG

also O
fired O
him O

were O
given O

Late O
word O

that O
the O

just O
hired O
Peter B-PERSON
Arnett E-PERSON

its O

in O

But O
the O
question O
remains O
Did O
Peter B-PERSON
Arnett E-PERSON

Geraldo B-PERSON

cross O
the O
line O
? O
or O
were O

We O
posed O

who O
have O
struggled O
against O
each O

almost O
as O
hard O
as O
the O

He O
is O
an O
orthodox O

but O
he O
supports O
truer O

for O
his O
country O

better O
relations O

the O
West S-LOC

Kostunica S-PERSON

what O

of O
the O
Tito S-PERSON

He O
refused O
an O

return O
in O
1989 S-DATE
because O
of O
his O
opposition O

In O
the B-DATE

he O
was O
careful O

his O

aid O
projects O
tied O
to O
reform O

which O
he O
describes O

Could O
a O
decision O
from O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court E-ORG
settle O
this O
case O
once O
and O
for O
all O
? O

At O
this O
stage O
, O
any O
decision O
from O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court E-ORG
is O
almost O
certainly O
not O
going O

provide O
a O

this O

Indeed O
, O
the O
issue O
is O
so O
narrow O
now O
before O
the B-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court E-ORG
that O
whichever O
way O
the O
court O
rules O
, O
it O
will O
likely O
have O
only O
the O
most O
marginal O
impact O
on O
what O

going O

in O
Florida S-GPE
. O

Even O
if O
the O
Bush S-PERSON
campaign O
prevails O
before O
the B-ORG

it O
simply O

we O

the O
next O

But O
you O
believe O
the O
fact O
that O
the B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court E-ORG
just O
decided O
to O
hear O
this O
case O
is O
a O
partial O

for O
both O
Bush S-PERSON

It O
is O
a O
partial O
victory O
for O
both O
sides O
. O

For O
the B-DATE
last I-DATE
two I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
, O
the O
central O
constitutional O
argument O
the O
Bush S-PERSON
campaign O
has O
been O
making O
to O
the O
federal O
courts O
is O
, O
stop O
these O
manual O
recounts O
now O
, O
they O
violate O
the O
Constitution S-WORK_OF_ART
. O

The B-ORG
U.S. I-ORG
Supreme I-ORG
Court E-ORG
refused O
to O
hear O
that O
part O

, O
agreeing O
with O
all O
the O

that O
this O

not O
the O

So O
in O
that O
sense O
, O
a O
victory O
for O
the O

For O
the O
Bush S-PERSON
campaign O

a O

What O
is O
your O
reaction O
to O
the O

that O

Well O
, O
I O
mean O
, O
we O
're O
certainly O
prepared O
to O
brief O
all O
the O
issues O
. O

I O
think O
that O
the O
circuit O

judge O
, O
Judge O
Sauls S-PERSON
gave O
a O
very O
well O
reasoned O
and O
thorough O
, O
both O
legal O
and O
factual O
discussion O
of O
Florida S-GPE
law O
. O

Well O
, O
let O
's O
talk O
about O
your O
statement O
earlier B-TIME
today E-TIME
that O
the O
Vice O
President O
-- O
I O
guess O
you O
were O
asked O
should O
the O
Vice O
President O
concede O
, O
and O
you O
answered O
, O
the O
Vice O
President O
should O
do O
what O
's O
best O
for O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States E-GPE
. O

Is O
that O
what O
you O
're O
trying O
to O
say O
? O

Well O
, O
sure O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
I O
think O
that O
all O
the O
people O
involved O
in O
this O
unique O
situation O
, O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
a O
presidential O
election O
in O
our O
history O
has O
been O
contested O
, O
Brian S-PERSON
, O
need O
to O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
and O
I O
'm O
sure O
do O
the O
right O
thing O
, O
as O
they O
see O
fit O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
the O
judge O
there O
, O
in O
addition O
to O
just O
giving O
out O
his O
ruling O
at O
the O
end O
of O
the O
court O
session O
today S-DATE
, O
he O
went O
on O
beyond O
the O
basic O
issues O
and O
added O
reason O
upon O
reason O
for O
why O
he O
turned O
down O
the O
Gore S-PERSON
case O
. O

Do O
you O
think O
his O
method O
there O
was O
to O
try O
to O
make O
this O
more O
or O
less O
appeal O
proof O
? O

Well O
, O
I O
think O
what O
he O
did O
was O
addressed O
the O
situation O
as O
it O
exists O
in O
Florida S-GPE
and O
addressed O
the O
contingencies O
that O
were O
raised O
in O
the O
voluminous O
briefs O
that O
he O
had O
, O
not O
only O
from O
the O
two S-CARDINAL
party O
candidates O
involved O
, O
but O
also O
of O
the O
interveners O
who O
were O
in O
the O
case O
. O

As O
you O
know O
, O
the O
Democratic S-NORP
line O
throughout O
is O
they O
wo O
n't O
be O
happy O
until O
every O
vote O
is O
counted O
, O
and O
we O
could O
n't O
help O
but O
notice O
, O
should O
we O
call O
it O
a O
rhetorical O
device O
you O
used O
when O
talking O
to O
reporters O
this B-TIME
afternoon E-TIME
. O

Pause O
and O
listen O
along O
with O
us O
to O
the O
following O
piece O
of O

. O

Those O
ballots O
have O
been O
counted O
not O
once O
on O
election B-TIME
night E-TIME
but O
twice O
in O
the O
recount O
and O
how O
many O
did O
you O
say O
there O
were O
? O

10,750 S-CARDINAL
-- O

If O
you O
know O
the O
exact O
number O
, O
does O
n't O
that O
mean O
they O
've O
been O
counted O
? O

So O
I O
do O
n't O
suppose O
that O
was O
any O
accident O
on O
your O
part O
? O

Well O
, O
they O
have O
been O
making O
this O
point O
throughout O
these O
proceedings O
that O
these O
ballots O
have O
never O
been O
counted O
, O
and O
that O
is O
factually O
not O
true O
. O

They O
have O
been O
counted O
on O
election B-TIME
night E-TIME
-- O
they O
've O
been O
counted O
in O
the O
recounts O
, O
and O
it O
simply O
happens O
to O
be O
not O
the O
case O
that O
those O
ballots O
have O
failed O
to O
be O
counted O
by O
anyone O
. O

Ben S-PERSON

what O
would O
your O

I O

all O

Brian S-PERSON

I O

that O

We O

all O
the O

Russia S-GPE

lower O
house O

has O
overwhelmingly O
approved O
restoring O
the O
former O
Soviet S-NORP
anthem O
as O
the O
Russian S-NORP
national O
anthem O
. O

The O
move O
had O
the O
strong O
support O
of O
Russian S-NORP
President O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Putin E-PERSON
who O
said O
use O
of O
the O
old O
anthem O
represented O
a O
gesture O
of O
reconciliation O
. O

Critics O
argued O
that O
the O
anthem O
is O
a O
throwback O
to O
the O
former O
totalitarian O
government O
. O

The O
anthem O
will O
have O
new O
words O
, O
eliminating O
verses O
that O
praised O
Communist S-NORP
leaders O
Vladimir B-PERSON
Lenin E-PERSON
and O
Joseph B-PERSON
Stalin E-PERSON
. O

The O
lower O
house O

also O
gave O
formal O
endorsement O
to O
Russia S-GPE

white O

red O

reinstated O
the O

all O
the O
legal O
maneuvering O
he O
is O
calling O
on O
both O
camps O
to O
put O
partisan O
politics O
aside O
. O

I O
think O
that O
both O
Governor O

I O
should O
recognize O
an O
obligation O
during O
this O
time O
when O
the O

still O
to O

counted O
, O
to O
try O
to O
restrain O

Meanwhile O
, O
Bush S-PERSON

Dick B-PERSON

was O
a O

today S-DATE

After O
a O

he O
appeared O
at O
a O
news O

to O
say O
that O
he O
is O
pressing O

with O

We O
have O
now O
acquired O
office O
space O
in O
McClain S-GPE
, O
Virginia S-GPE
that O
will O
become O
the O
site O
for O
the O
transition O
operation O
that O
we O
announced O
two B-DATE
days I-DATE
ago E-DATE
, O
so O
we O
are O
just O
in O
a O
business O
of O
getting O
up O

running O
, O
but O
we O
now O
have O
an O
office O

a O

We O
have O

people O
signing O

Earlier B-TIME
today E-TIME
in O
Florida S-GPE

the O

should O
the O

the O

The O
committee O
heard O
from O
angry O
voters O
and O
precinct O
workers O
in O
Palm B-GPE
Beach E-GPE
. O

I O
believe O
our O
issues O
do O
relate O
directly O
to O
the O
appointing O
of O
electors O
for O
the O
state O
of O
Florida S-GPE
. O

The O
electors O
need O
to O
be O
appointed O
, O
are O
supposed O
to O
be O
appointed O
according O
to O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
and O
I O
believe O
in O
Palm B-GPE
Beach I-GPE
County E-GPE
that O
it O
was O
very O
difficult O
to O
determine O
what O
the O
will O
of O
the O
people O
was O
. O

Although O
Al B-PERSON
Gore E-PERSON
said O
today S-DATE
that O
he O
certainly O
feels O
like O
he O
won O
the O
election O
, O
he O
put O
his O
odds O
of O
wining O
the O
various O
legal O
battles O
at O
fifty S-CARDINAL
- O
fifty S-CARDINAL
. O

Gore S-PERSON
said O
, O
if O
Bush S-PERSON
does O
triumph O
in O
court O
, O
he O
will O
throw O
his O
support O
behind O
the O
Republican S-NORP
President O
- O
elect O
. O

But O
for O
now O
, O
says O
former O
Clinton S-PERSON
administration O
cabinet O
member O
Robert B-PERSON
Riche E-PERSON
, O
both O
sides O
are O
positive O
that O
they O
've O
won O
the O
election O
, O
and O
says O
Riche S-PERSON
, O
the O
longer O
the O
fight O
goes O
on O
, O
the O
more O
troublesome O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
four I-DATE
years E-DATE
might O
be O
. O

What O
we O
risk O
by O
prolonging O
this O
is O
greater O
public O
cynicism O
and O
a O
hardening O
of O
partisan O
lines O
among O
career O
politicians O
who O
have O
to O
work O

. O

After O
all O

these O

are O
going O
to O
have O

be O
in O
Washington S-GPE

You O

, O
professor O

at O
Yale S-ORG
, O
says O
President O
Kostunica S-PERSON
should O
cooperate O
immediately O
with O
the B-ORG
Hague I-ORG
Tribunal E-ORG
. O

This O
particular O
UN S-ORG
institution O
has O
in O
its O
power O
really O
to O
give O
instant O
legitimacy O
to O
Kostunica S-PERSON
but O
of O
course O
at O
a O
price O
. O

It O
means O
that O
the O
government O
of O
Yugoslavia S-GPE
has O
to O
become O
very O
serious O
about O
dealing O
with O
the O
indited O
war O
criminals O
, O
beginning O
with O
Slobodan B-PERSON
Milosevic E-PERSON
himself O
. O

But O
even O
officials O
at O
The B-GPE
Hague E-GPE
say O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
be O
patient O
with O
the O
new O
Yugoslav S-NORP
President O
. O

Tribunal S-ORG
spokesman O
Jim B-PERSON
Landel E-PERSON
says O
it O
helps O
that O
Kostunica S-PERSON
's O
people O
who O
initially O
refused O
to O
even O
entertain O
the O
idea O
of O
arresting O
Milosevic S-PERSON
, O
may O
be O
starting O
to O
cooperate O
with O
the O
Tribunal S-ORG
. O

They O
have O
already O
indicated O
that O
they O
are O
willing O
to O
allow O
the O
reopening O
of O
the O
prosecutor O
's O
liaison O
office O
in O
Belgrade S-GPE
, O
and O
that O
's O
certainly O
a O
welcome O
first S-ORDINAL
step O
. O

However O
, O
it O
is O
only O
a O
first S-ORDINAL
step O
. O

The O
Tribunal S-ORG
's O
chief O
prosecutor O
Carla B-PERSON
Del I-PERSON
Ponte E-PERSON
has O
applied O
for O
a O
Yugoslav S-NORP
visa O
and O
plans O
to O
visit O
Belgrade S-GPE
soon O
. O

Delponte S-PERSON
's O
spokeswoman O
says O
the O
prosecutor O
has O
much O
to O
discuss O
with O
Kostunica S-PERSON
, O
not O
least O
how O
to O
arrest O
all O
the O
indited O
war O
crimes O
suspects O
now O
in O
Serbia S-GPE
. O

That O
wo O
n't O
be O
easy O
. O

Even O
in O
Bosnia S-GPE
where O
Nato S-ORG
is O
in O
charge O
, O
troops O
have O
failed O
to O
capture O
Bosnian B-NORP
- I-NORP
Serb E-NORP
leader O
Radavan B-PERSON
Karadzic E-PERSON
, O
indited O
on O
genocide O
charges O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
1995 S-DATE
massacre O
at O
Shrabanitca S-GPE
. O

Yale S-ORG
history O
professor O
Eva B-PERSON
Barnett E-PERSON
says O
the O
excuses O
for O
not O
arresting O
Karadzic S-PERSON
are O
not O
persuasive O
. O

The O
claim O
is O
that O
this O
would O
engender O
tremendously O
destabilizing O
consequences O
that O
in O
any O
event O
it O
might O
be O
a O
very O
, O
very O
bloody O
affair O
and O
so O
on O
. O

This O
does O
not O
seem O
terribly O
compelling O
to O
me O
. O

I O
think O
that O
it O
has O
to O
be O
tried O
and O
of O
course O
there O
is O
always O
a O
danger O
that O
somebody O
might O
get O
hurt O
in O
this O
, O
but O
that O
is O
a O
danger O
that O
every O
attempt O
at O
remedying O
criminal O
activity O
has O
to O
face O
. O

Hague S-ORG
prosecutor O
Carla B-PERSON
Del I-PERSON
Ponte E-PERSON
is O
prepared O
to O
discuss O
arrest O
strategies O
with O
Kostunica S-PERSON
including O
the O
use O
of O
foreign O
troops O
. O

It O
's O
difficult O
to O
know O
how O
he O
would O
react O
. O

Kostunica S-PERSON
has O
questioned O
the O
legality O
of O
the B-ORG
Hague I-ORG
Tribunal E-ORG
, O
and O
talked O
of O
trying O
Milosevic S-PERSON

Professor O
Lee S-PERSON
, O
I O
gather O
you O
know O
the O
man O
and O
know O
his O
work O
. O

Tell O
us O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
him O
, O
Who O
is O
he O
and O
why O
did O
he O
flee O
China S-GPE
. O

Gao B-PERSON
Xingjian E-PERSON
is O
quite O
an O
interesting O
writer O
because O
in O
some O
senses O
he O
differs O
from O
the O
great O
cohort O
of O
contemporary O
Chinese S-NORP
writers O
that O
are O
well O
known O
in O
the O
West S-LOC
today O
. O

I O
would O
say O
that O
the O
great O
difference O
about O
Gao B-PERSON
Xingjian E-PERSON
is O
that O
he O
actually O
received O
a O
university O
education O
. O

He O
was O
educated O
in O
French S-LANGUAGE
, O
so O
has O
a O
very O
good O
knowledge O
of O
French S-NORP
literature O
and O
it O
is O
very O
much O
French S-NORP
literature O
that O
has O
influenced O
his O
own O
literary O
creativities O
, O
only O
free O
production O
, O
so O
much O
so O
that O
conservative O
Chinese S-NORP
critics O
would O
accuse O
him O
of O
blind O
worship O
of O
Western S-NORP
models O
. O

Sartre S-PERSON
is O
a O
big O
man O
in O
Mr. O
Xingjian S-PERSON
's O
life O
, O
is O
n't O
he O
? O

I O
would O
say O
so O
that O
Sartre S-PERSON
has O
been O
a O
quite O
a O
big O
influence O
. O

I O
think O
the O
other O
influences O
would O
be O
Samuel B-PERSON
Beckett E-PERSON
, O
the O
Irish S-LANGUAGE
and O
French S-LANGUAGE
language O
writer O
, O
Unesco S-PERSON
. O

These O
are O
models O
and O
, O
of O
course O
, O
all O
of O
these O
writers O
are O
writers O
who O
were O
active O
in O
the B-DATE
first I-DATE
half I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
twentieth I-DATE
century E-DATE
. O

Well O
, O
this O
is O
very O
interesting O
because O
Mr. O
Gao S-PERSON
left O
China S-GPE
before O
Tianenmen S-EVENT
. O

He O
wrote O
a O
play O
, O
in O
particular O
about O
the O
events O
there O
. O

Would O
you O
say O
that O
his O
influences O
may O
be O
more O
French S-NORP
literary O
then O
they O
were O
his O
own O
immediate O
life O
experience O
? O

I O
would O
say O
both O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
because O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
play O
that O
he O
wrote O
that O
made O
him O
famous O
was O
a O
play O
that O
dates O
from O
1981 S-DATE
, O
which O
was O
actually O
called O
` B-WORK_OF_ART
Bus I-WORK_OF_ART
Stop I-WORK_OF_ART
' E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
which O
many O
people O
said O
or O
had O
resonances O
from O
Beckett S-PERSON
's O
play O
` O
Waiting B-WORK_OF_ART
for I-WORK_OF_ART
Godot E-WORK_OF_ART
' O
and O
it O
concerned O
a O
number O
of O
Chinese S-NORP
people O
from O
different O
walks O
of O
life O
who O
were O
standing O
at O
a O
bus O
stop O
waiting O
for O
a O
bus O
that O
never O
came O
. O

So O
, O
we O
can O
see O
immediately O
that O
the O
resonances O
with O
the O
play O
of O
Beckett S-PERSON
, O
but O
Gao B-PERSON
Xingjian E-PERSON
really O
before O
1989 S-DATE
felt O
, O
that O
he O
was O
unable O
to O
write O
and O
to O
have O
his O
plays O
produced O
, O
as O
he O
would O
wish O
, O
and O
so O
left O
China S-GPE
couple B-DATE
of I-DATE
years E-DATE
before O
the O
incident O
at O
Tiananmen S-FAC
in O
1989 S-DATE
. O

I O
think O
it O
is O
a B-DATE
great I-DATE
day E-DATE
for O
modern O
Chinese S-NORP
literature O
and O
it O
is O
a B-DATE
day E-DATE
that O
has O
been O
awaited O
for O
the B-DATE
past I-DATE
60 I-DATE

70 I-DATE

President O

crazes O
that O
we O
are O
having O
in O
the O
Italy S-GPE
at O
the O
moment O
, O
one S-CARDINAL
is O
internet O
, O
the O
other O
one S-CARDINAL
is O
the O
awareness O
on O
food O
. O

So O
this O
guy O
came O
up O
with O
the O
idea O
of O
having O
people O
adopting O
sheep O
by O
an O
internet O
. O

So O
you O
can O
have O
access O
through O
your O
computer O
on O
your O
desk O
. O

Go O
to O
the O
web O
site O
of O
these O
guys O
and O
you O
can O
have O
look O
at O
the O
face O
of O
sheep O
which O
are O
available O
to O
be O
adopted O
. O

So O
what O
does O
it O
mean O
to O
adopt O
a O
sheep O
, O
to O
show O
up O
on O
your O
back O
step O
or O
do O
you O
, O
somehow O
keep O
track O
of O
its O
progress O
on O
the O
farm O
in O
Italy S-GPE
? O

You O
are O
not O
actually O
adopting O
the O
sheep O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
you O
can O
have O
it O
with O
you O
. O

It O
looks O
like O
distant O
adoption O
, O
where O
you O
do O
n't O
actually O
have O
the O
child O
in O
your O
home O
. O

You O
are O
just O
contributing O
with O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
money O
and O
you O
are O
monitoring O
the O
growing O
up O
. O

It O
works O
in O
the O
same O
way O
, O
so O
you O
have O
access O
on O
the O
web O
site O
of O
this O
little O
farm O
, O
in O
a O
little O
village O
of O
Abrutzi S-GPE
and O
you O
can O
choose O
among O
many O
, O
many O
sheeps O
and O
after O
contributing O
with O
a O
certain O
amount O
of O
money O
the O
sheep O
is O
actually O
yours O
. O

All O
right O
, O
so O
the O
amount O
of O
money O
you O
have O
mentioned O
to O
us O
is O
about B-MONEY
160 I-MONEY
US I-MONEY
dollars E-MONEY
and O
for O
that O
you O
get O
more O
than O
just O
a O
warm O
and O
fuzzy O
feeling O
. O

You O
can O
also O
receive O
leggings O
that O
are O
made O
from O
wool O
of O
the O
sheep O
and O
even O
if O
you O
like O
some O
of O
the O
sheep O
dropping O
delivered O
to O
your O
door O
. O

Yeah O
, O
I O
mean O
this O
is O
quite O
funny O
, O
but O
apart O
from O
all O
the O
details O
, O
which O
are O
sometimes O
even O
strange O
I O
think O
what O
is O
really O
important O
is O
that O
it O
is O
a O
sign O
of O
a O
new O
concern O
that O
is O
effecting O
Italian S-NORP
people O
. O

I O
mean O
we O
are O
notoriously O
lover O
of O
good O
food O
. O

We O
have O
a O
generous O
attitude O
towards O
food O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
new O
stuff O
. O

The O
fact O
that O
you O
really O
care O
about O
a O
sheep O
in O
the O
way O
she O
is O
fed O
, O
in O
the O
way O
she O
is O
nurtured O
, O
in O
the O
way O
people O
are O
looking O
after O
it O
, O
because O
it O
's O
a O
way O
to O
ensure O
that O
you O
have O
something O
which O
is O
genuine O
on O
your O
table O
up O
the O
end O
. O

Wait O
a B-TIME
minute E-TIME
, O
you O
said O
that O
on O
your O
table O
at O
the O
end O
. O

Yeah O
, O
at O
the O
table O
if O
it O
becomes O
food O
for O
instance O
, O
which O
is O
an O
option O
. O

You O
are O
adopting O
the O
sheep O
and O
whatever O
happens O
at O
the O
end O
it O
's O
your O
choice O
and O
among O
the O
option O
is O
you O
know O
food O
for O
your O
meal O
. O

That O
kind O
of O
puts O
a O
whole O
new O
tone O
to O
this O
thing O
. O

I O
mean O
usually O
when O
you O
think O
of O
this O
kind O
of O
adoption O
that O
means O
saving O
an O
animal O
not O
eventually O
eating O
it O
. O

I O
mean O
this O
is O
an O
option O
which O
is O
available O
and O
I O
think O
it O
is O
a O
sort O
of O
provocation O
. O

You O
know O
Italians S-NORP
now O
mainly O
live O
in O
metropolitan O
areas O
in O
big O
cities O
like O
Rome S-GPE
, O
Florence S-GPE
, O
Naples S-GPE
. O

In O
the O
past O
, O
we O
were O
a O
population O
of O
shepherds O
or O
farmers O
. O

We O
had O
completely O
different O
attitude O
towards O
nature O
. O

It O
seems O
that O
we O
are O
losing O
something O
, O
and O
we O
need O
to O
reestablish O
a O
better O
relationship O
with O
nature O
and O
the O
simple O
fact O
that O
the O
Environment O
Minister O
in O
Italy S-GPE
supported O
the O
initiative O
and O
he O
himself O
adopted O
a O
sheep O
is O
significant O
. O

He O
took O
advantage O
immediately O
of O
these O
ideas O
to O
build O
up O
a O
new O
awareness O
and O
a O
new O
attitude O
of O
Italians S-NORP
towards O
nature O
and O
farms O
. O

Mr. O

, O
who O
recently O
returned O

Mr. O
Hanky S-PERSON
says O
that O
President O
Kostunica S-PERSON
has O
only O
two S-CARDINAL
options O
for O
achieving O
financial O
stability O
in O
Serbia S-GPE
. O

He O
can O
either O
abandon O
the O
dinar O
and O
adopt O
the O
German S-NORP
mark O
as O
the B-GPE
Yugoslav I-GPE
Republic I-GPE
of I-GPE
Montenegro E-GPE
has O
done O
or O
, O
Mr. O
Hanky S-PERSON
says O
, O
Serbia S-GPE
can O
adopt O
a O
currency O
board O
system O
under O
which O
a O
new O

would O
be O
issued O
under O
conditions O
of O
utmost O
financial O
discipline O
. O

I O
think O
if O
Kostunica S-PERSON
does O
not O
move O
in O
a O
direction O
decisively O
within O
the B-DATE
next I-DATE
month E-DATE
of O
abandoning O
the O
dinar O
completely O
or O
going O
to O
a O
deutsche O
mark O
based O
currency O
board O
where O
we O
have O
a O
foreign O
governor O
on O
the O
board O
, O
the O
chances O
for O
economic O
unification O
in O
the O
area O
and O
economic O
recovery O
in O
Serbia S-GPE
are O
slim O
at O
best O
. O

Mr. O
Hanky S-PERSON
says O
it O
's O
essential O
that O
President O
Kostunica S-PERSON
embrace O
the O
principle O
of O
sound O
money O
, O
something O
Mr. O
Hanky S-PERSON
believes O
is O
as O
important O
as O
the O
rule O
of O
law O
. O

Last B-DATE
week E-DATE
, O
the O
new O
acting O
head O
of O
the B-ORG
Yugoslav I-ORG
Central I-ORG
Bank E-ORG
devalued O
the O
dinar O
, O
bringing O
it O
to O
30 S-CARDINAL
to O
the O
dollar O
, O
compared O
to O
the O
previous O
official O
rate O
of O
20 S-CARDINAL
. O

Mr. O
Hanky S-PERSON
, O
who O
regards O
the O
dinar O
as O
the O
world O
's O
worst O
currency O
, O
says O
the O
deutsch O
mark O
is O
becoming O
the O
de O
facto O
money O
in O
the O
entire O
Balkan S-LOC
region O
. O

If O
they O
use O
the O
d O
mark O
in O
Serbia S-GPE
, O
obviously O
there O
would O
be O
essentially O
the O
same O
system O
that O
they O
have O
in O
Montenegro S-GPE
and O
if O
they O
had O
a O
currency O
board O
with O
a O
foreign O
national O
running O
the O
thing O
, O
like O
Bosnia S-GPE
, O
it O
would O
essentially O
mean O
that O
they O
had O
a O
unified O
system O
was O
what O
they O
have O
in O
Montenegro S-GPE
because O
with O
Montenegro S-GPE
, O
they O
would O
still O
have O
the O
d O
mark O
as O
legal O
tender O
, O
but O
they O
would O
also O
use O
this O
new O
currency O
board O
money O
from O
Serbia S-GPE
and O
there O
would O
be O
absolutely O
no O
problem O
, O
and O
furthermore O
, O
from O
a O
regional O
point O
of O
view O
, O
you O
'd O
have O
essentially O
most O
of O
the O
Balkans S-LOC
in O
a O
unified O
currency O
zone O
because O
Bulgaria S-GPE
has O
a O
currency O
board O
that O

. O

Bosnia S-GPE

a O

an O

that O

-- O

Sandra B-PERSON

, O

the O

Olson S-PERSON
argued O
that O
a O

old E-DATE
federal O
statute O
prevents O

the O
fact O
which O
, O
he O
claimed O
, O
is O
just O
what O
the O
Florida S-GPE
court O
did O
, O
and O
also O
, O
that O
the B-LAW
U.S. I-LAW
Constitution E-LAW
gives O
state O
legislatures O
, O
not O
the O

, O
the O
right O

Of O

it O
was O

so O
it O
went O
on O

Laurence B-PERSON

attorney O
, O
said O
the O
state O

did O
nothing O

It O
simply O
provided O
a O
way O
for O
a O
close O

be O
examined O
. O

Justice O
O'Connor S-PERSON
again O
, O
but O
this O
time O
suggesting O
the O
state O
court O
had O
overstepped O
its O
authority O
and O
perhaps O
there O
was O
a O
federal O
case O
here O
. O

Justice O
Antonin B-PERSON
Scalia E-PERSON
also O
pressed O
Tribe S-PERSON
. O

He O
said O
the O
state O
court O
relied O
on O
the B-LAW
Florida I-LAW
Constitution E-LAW
to O
draft O
its O
decision O
, O
excluding O
state O
lawmakers O
and O
that O
violated O
the B-LAW
U.S. I-LAW

. O

It O
was O
Justice O

who O
asked O
the O
most O
straightforward O
question O
of O
all O
. O

What O
happens O
if O
the O

of O
Bush S-PERSON
? O

The O
answer O
from O
the O

, O
Bush S-PERSON
wins O

all O
the O

Not O
everyone O
agrees O

They O
say O
that O
no O

And O
there O
are O
some O
new O
developments O
to O
talk O
about O
tonight S-TIME

Scientists O
may O
be O
even O
closer O
to O
solving O
the O
mystery O
/. O

For O
an O
update O
we O
're O
joined O
by O
Dr. O
Robert B-PERSON
Mann E-PERSON
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
senior O
scientists O
you O
just O
saw O
working O
on O
this O
cold O
case O
/. O

Thanks O
for O
spending O
time O
with O
us O
tonight S-TIME
doctor O
/. O

We O
understand O
since O
Thelma S-PERSON
left O
your O
laboratories O
you O
've O
now O
wittled O
this O
down O
to O
perhaps O
four S-CARDINAL
airmen O
/. O

is O
that O
true O
/? O

Well O
hi O
Paula S-PERSON
/. O

yes O
we O
have O
/. O

Uh O
when O
the O
remains O
came O
in O
a B-DATE
little I-DATE
over I-DATE
a I-DATE
week I-DATE
ago E-DATE
our O
analysts O
and O
historians O
got O
to O
work O
on O
that O
/. O

and O
they O
were O
able O
to O
wittle O
it O
down O
the O
number O
of O
missing O
aircraft O
uh O
to O
a O
few O
/. O

and O
at O
this O
point O
they O
've O
wittled O
it O
down O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
aircraft O
and O
a O
missing O
crew O
of O
four S-CARDINAL
individuals O
/. O

So O
we O
've O
gone O
from O
several O
possible O
aircraft O
to O
one S-CARDINAL
aircraft O
and O
from O
several O
missing O
airmen O
to O
four S-CARDINAL
/. O

So O
how O
much O
easier O
will O
that O
make O
it O
for O
you O
to O
unlock O
this O
case O
, O
do O
you O
think O
/? O

Well O
I O
think O
it O
'll O
help O
quite O
a O
bit O
/. O

Um O
any O
time O
you O
've O
got O
a O
body O
uh O
or O
remains O
like O
this O
that O
has O
come O
in O
and O
they O
're O
in O
pretty O
good O
condition O
such O
as O
this O
one O
is O
, O
it O
's O
mummified O
remains O
/. O

We O
have O
some O
soft O
tissue O
we O
can O
deal O
with O
/. O

so O
we O
can O
look O
at O
the O
color O
of O
the O
hair O
/. O

we O
can O
tell O
right O
away O
the O
race O
and O
the O
sex O
of O
the O
individual O
/. O

but O
then O
there O
are O
other O
things O
that O
are O
hidden O
beneath O
the O
soft O
tissue O
that O
are O
revealed O
only O
in O
the O
skeleton O
/. O

and O
that O
's O
where O
we O
're O
going O
to O
now O
/. O

So O
in O
the O
interest O
of O
full O
disclosure O
what O
I O
know O
about O
forensics O
is O
basically O
what O
I O
've O
learned O
on O
CSI S-WORK_OF_ART
/. O

and O
one O
would O
think O
that O
because O
you O
've O
got O
it O
now O
narrowed O
down O
to O
four S-CARDINAL
potential O
airmen O
that O
perhaps O
you O
could O
go O
to O
four S-CARDINAL
families O
get O
strands O
of O
hair O
and O
try O
to O
do O
a O
potential O
DNA O
match O
with O
what O
you O
've O
found O
in O
the O
ice O
/. O

Is O
it O
not O
that O
simple O
/? O

Well O
no O
no O
it O
's O
not O
that O
simple O
/. O

Um O
one O
thing O
we O
always O
caution O
people O
about O
is O
the O
pool O
of O
aircraft O
and O
missing O
airmen O
could O
be O
larger O
than O
what O
we O
're O
looking O
at O
/. O

And O
what O
we O
want O
to O
do O
is O
we O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
just O
look O
at O
the O
material O
evidence O
that O
we O
have O
and O
immediately O
um O
jump O
to O
a O
conclusion O
that O
this O
is O
a O
certain O
individual O
/. O

What O
we O
want O
to O
do O
is O
have O
the O
evidence O
speak O
for O
itself O
/. O

and O
when O
we O
look O
at O
this O
individual O
as O
we O
've O
done O
the O
biological O
profile O
looking O
at O
his O
remains O
his O
bones O
his O
teeth O
and O
the O
material O
evidence O
/. O

and O
what O
we O
're O
able O
to O
tell O
from O
this O
individual O
is O
that O
he O
died O
in O
his B-DATE
twenties E-DATE
he O
stood O
somewhere O
between O
five B-QUANTITY
foot I-QUANTITY
nine E-QUANTITY
and O
six B-QUANTITY
foot I-QUANTITY
two I-QUANTITY
inches E-QUANTITY
tall O
um O
he O
sustained O
massive O
trauma O
to O
his O
body O
on O
impact O
/. O

And O
he O
's O
Caucasoid S-NORP
male O
/. O

and O
so O
we O
know O
much O
more O
now O
just B-DATE
one I-DATE
week I-DATE
later E-DATE
than O
what O
we O
did O
when O
he O
came O
in O
about B-DATE
eight I-DATE
days I-DATE
ago E-DATE
/. O

So O
the O
most O
important O
question O
is O
when O
do O
you O
think O
you O
're O
going O
to O
know O
exactly O
who O
he O
is O
/? O

Well O
that O
's O
the O
most O
commonly O
asked O
question O
that O
we O
have O
/. O

and O
you O
know O
the O
reality O
is O
nobody O
can O
give O
you O
the O
answer O
/. O

Nobody O
knows O
for O
sure O
exactly O
when O
we O
'll O
identify O
him O
/. O

What O
it O
depends O
on O
is O
that O
all O
the O
lines O
of O
evidence O
come O
together O
for O
successful O
identification O
/. O

If O
I O
were O
to O
give O
my O
best O
opinion O
in O
this O
it O
would O
be O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
to O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE

we O
'll O

Uh O
let O

talk O

the O

we O
only O

uh O

Well O
the O
authorities O

the O
FBI S-ORG

found O
out O

checked O
this O

out O
early O
on O
just B-DATE

after O
Natalee S-PERSON
disappeared O

And O
we O
just O
found O
out O
about O
this O
witness O
a B-DATE
couple I-DATE
weeks I-DATE
ago E-DATE
/. O

That O
's O
when O
his O
existence O
became O
widely O
known O
through O
private O
investigators O
and O
other O
sources O

And O
it O
has O
been O
reported O
that O
he O
was O
afraid O

come O
forward O

Well O
it O
turns O
out O
he O
was O
just O
afraid O
for O
his O
identity O
to O
be O
known O
/. O

but O
we O
learned O
that O
he O
came O
forward O
very O
quickly O
after O
he O
says O
he O
saw O
what O
happened O
in O
the O
landfill O
that B-DATE
day E-DATE
just B-DATE
days E-DATE
after O
it O
happened O
/. O

He O
talked O
to O
police O
/. O

He O
talked O
to O
the O
FBI S-ORG
/. O

The O
FBI S-ORG
actually O
went O
out O
to O
that O
landfill O
with O
dogs O
looked O
around O
that O
area O
even O
before O
it O
became O
piled O
up O
with O
garbage O
/. O

and O
they O
did O
n't O
find O
anything O
/. O

It O
's O
the O
EquuSearch S-ORG
volunteers O
who O
really O
said O
hey O
we O
believe O
this O
guy O
/. O

His O
story O
does O
n't O
change O
/. O

He O
seems O
to O
pan O
out O
/. O

He O
seems O
to O
be O
a O
lucid O
guy O
/. O

He O
seems O
to O
also O
be O
insistent O
that O
he O
saw O
something O
/. O

So O
he O
says O
he O
saw O
some O
men O
drive O
up O
in O
a O
white O
pickup O
truck O
men O
that O
he O
says O
he O
later O
recognized O
to O

the O
three S-CARDINAL
suspects O
in O
this O
case O

He O
says O
they O
took O
what O
looked O
like O
a O
body O
out O
of O
the O
back O
of O
the O
pickup O
truck O
/. O

It O
was O
wrapped O
up O
in O
a O
bag O

But O
when O
the O
wind O
blew O
he O
says O
he O
saw O
the O
upper O
part O
of O
a O
woman O

body O
blonde O
hair O

and O
then O
he O
says O
they O
buried O
this O
body O
there O
in O
the O
landfill O
/. O

Well O
over O
a B-DATE
period I-DATE
of I-DATE
weeks E-DATE
some B-QUANTITY
ten I-QUANTITY
feet E-QUANTITY
of O
garbage O
has O
piled O
up O
/. O

EquuSearch S-ORG
will O
tell O
you O
too O
that O
when O
they O
bring O
out O
dogs O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
for O
a O
dog O
to O
catch O
a O
scent O
in O
that O
landfill O
when O
they O
're O
coming O
across O
things O
like O
medical O
waste O
/. O

but O
they O
're O
determined O
to O
keep O
going O
/. O

He O
saw O
uh O
the O
woman O
's O
body O
and O
inside O
a O
bag O
/. O

Her O
hair O
was O
blowing O
out O
with O
the O
wind O
/. O

And O
uh O
he O
did O
n't O
say O
this O
now O
/. O

but O
he O
told O
that O
the O
back O
kind O
of O
came O
off O
and O
he O
saw O
half O
of O
the O
woman O
's O
body O
/. O

One O
of O
the O
most O
compelling O
reasons O
searchers O
say O
they O
believe O
this O
guy O
very O
much O
is O
that O
they O
say O
he O
gave O
them O
some O
clues O
as O
to O
things O
they O
would O
find O
buried O
deep O
within O
that O
garbage O
around O
that O
same O
area O
where O
he O
claims O
he O
saw O
a O
body O
things O
like O
a O
plastic O
pool O
/. O

He O
said O
that O
there O
was O
a O
dirt O
road O
buried O
under O
all O
that O
garbage O
/. O

Well O
they O
found O
those O
things O
and O
a O
couple O
of O
other O
items O
that O
he O
said O
would O
be O
there O
/. O

The O
problem O
is O
they O
just O
have O
n't O
found O
any O
sign O
at O
all O
of O
Natalee B-PERSON
Holloway E-PERSON

but O
they O
want O
to O
clear O
that O
place O
out O
and O
just O
feel O
satisfied O
that O
they O
looked O
as O
best O
they O
could O
because O
it O
's O
disturbing O
/. O

I O
mean O
his O
story O
has O
panned O
out O
in O
some O
ways O

so O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
to O
give O
this O
up O
/. O

Well O
that O
's O
the O
question O
I O
have O
for O
you O
Michelle S-PERSON
/. O

So O
are O
you O
saying O
that O
the O
authorities O
uh O
looked O
into O
this O
guy O
's O
story O
early O
on O

they O
kind O
of O
pooh O

poohed O
it O
and O
then O
EquuSearch S-ORG
came O
in O
a B-DATE

said O
wait O
a O
sec O
, O
wait O
a O
sec O
, O
let O
's O
give O
this O
guy O
a O
shot O
here O
and O
they O
followed O
up O
on O
it O
/? O

Yeah O
pretty O
much O
/. O

Uh O
the O
witness O
told O
us O
directly O
that O
in O
the O
beginning O
he O
felt O
like O
nobody O
was O
believing O
his O
story O
/. O

But O
we O
talked O
to O
a O
high O
level O
source O
in O
law O
enforcement O
/. O

and O
it O
turns O
out O
they O
did O
check O
it O
out O
/. O

Hm O
/. O

They O
sent O
the O
FBI S-ORG
out O
there O
with O
a O
dog O
/. O

But O
EquuSearch S-ORG
says O
hey O
maybe O
we O
can O
do O
something O
more O
thoroughly O
here O
/. O

We O
can O
bring O
out O
teams O
of O
dogs O
/. O

But O
here O
's O
the O
thing O
/. O

They O
still O
have O
n't O
found O
one S-CARDINAL
sign O
of O
her O
/. O

but O
uh O
they O
are O
determined O
to O
keep O
it O
up O
through O
the B-DATE
weekend E-DATE
at O
least O
/. O

you O

um O
you O

No O

but O
what O
I O
was O
looking O
for O

a O
history O

a O
predatory O
type O
behavior O
which O
I O
think O
Joran S-PERSON

how O
tightly O

Now O
i- O

Joining O
me O
now O
is O
the O
private O

Thank O
you O

TJ O
let O
me O
start O
with O
you O
on O
this O
issue O
of O
this O
woman O
uh O
who O
came O
up O
uh O
to O
Beth S-PERSON

Have O
you O
been O
able O
to O
follow O
up O
on O
that O

and O
how O
relevant O
do O
you O
think O
it O
is O
/? O

Uh O
we O
have O
n't O
followed O
up O
with O
it O
/. O

Um O
Beth S-PERSON
and O
I O
have O
talked O
about O
it O
/. O

and O
we O
will O
be O
following O
up O
on O
it O
uh O
here O
shortly O
/. O

is O
it O
relevant O
/? O

I O
mean O
a O
lot O
of O
my O
viewers O
wrote O
in O
saying O
alright O
so O
what O
/. O

this O
guy O
's O
a O
pickup O
artist O
/. O

how O
does O
that O
really O
impact O
the O
case O
/? O

Well O
it O
just O
shows O
it O
's O
a O
pattern O
of O
um O
what O
his O
activity O
is O
when O
he O
hangs O
out O
at O
Carlos B-ORG
N' I-ORG
Charlie I-ORG
's E-ORG
/. O

I O
mean O
and O
trying O
to O
pick O
women O
up O
and O
take O
them O
from O
the O
bar O
and O
whatever O
he O
's O
doing O
with O
them O
after O
that O
/. O

But O
if O
there O
's O
no O
violence O
associated O
with O
that O
does O
that O
help O
you O
in O
the O
investigation O
/? O

Well O
again O
we O
do O
n't O
think O
there O
was O
a O
violent O
issue O
with O
him O
with O
Natalee S-PERSON
/. O

We O
think O
probably O
+something O
has O
happened O
to O
Natalee S-PERSON
/. O

and O
they O
panicked O
and O
then O
went O
forth O
and O
did O
what O
they O
were O
supposed O
to O
do O
/. O

I O
mean O
there O
's O
issues O
that O
's O
come O
up O
/. O

Um O
um O
well O
we O
feel O
something O
happened O
when O
Natalee S-PERSON
was O
with O
them O
/. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
by O
that O
/? O

Either O
she O
either O
passed O
out O
regurgitated O
/. O

um O
something O
had O
happened O
/. O

And O
on O
top O
of O
that O
now O
there O
's O
a O
statement O
that O
's O
come O
up O
from O
Joran B-PERSON
Van I-PERSON
Der I-PERSON
Sloot E-PERSON
that O
he O
's O
given O
to O
the O
police O
uh O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
twenty B-CARDINAL
- I-CARDINAL
two E-CARDINAL
statements O
he O
's O
given O
by O
the O
way O
that O
um O
Deepak S-PERSON
had O
uh O
raped O
her O
and O
killed O
her O
on O
the O
beach O
/. O

So O
at O
this O
point O
what O
the O
police O
have O
you O
know O
again O
we O
're O
unaware O
because O
we O
're O
not O
getting O
any O
information O
from O
law O
enforcement O
/. O

so O
we O
have O
to O
go O
on O
the O
course O
of O
information O
that O
we O
're O
gathering O
on O
behalf O
of O
the O
family O
/. O



Well O
let O
me O
ask O
Harold S-PERSON
how O
do O
you O
all O
know O
that O
/? O

I O
mean O
that O
information O
for O
example O
about O
that O
particular O
statement O
that O
TJ S-PERSON
was O
just O
mentioning O
/. O

How O
do O
we O
know O
that O
/? O

how O
do O
you O
know O
that O
that O
statement O
was O

/? O

Oh O
we O
do O
n't O
/. O

This O
is O
the O
statements O
that O
were O
being O

to O
us O
on O
those O
/. O

Uh O
since O
we O
have O
n't O
interviewed O
Joran S-PERSON
we O
do O
n't O
know O
exactly O
what O
he O
has O
said O

some O
of O

has O
been O
let O

and O
uh O
through O
a O

different O

uh O
they O
have O
told O

uh O
what O
the O

was O

'm O

that O
from O

that O
statement O

Uh O
now O
as O
far O

the O
cruise O
uh O
I O
was O
on O
the O
cruise O
that B-DATE
uh I-DATE
uh I-DATE
day E-DATE

and O
the O
way O
I O
became O
aware O
of O
what O
occured O
was O
that O
uh O
the B-TIME
morning E-TIME
of O
the B-DATE
fifth E-DATE
a O
relative O
of O

had O
mentioned O
that O
there O
was O
blood O
stain O
on O
the O
canopy O

her O
uh O
balcony O

at O
that O
point O
we O
kind O

dismissed O
it O

We O
did O
n't O
know O

was O
uh O
going O

later O
on O

uh O
the O

made O
an O
announcement O

uh O
authorities O
were O

they O
were O

the O
night S-TIME

early B-TIME

When O
I O
asked O
my O
cousin O
the O
uh O
size O
of O
the O
blood O
splatter O
she O
had O
indicated O
it O
was O
relatively O
the O
size O
of O
a O
small O
uh O
dog O

a O

However O
viewing O
those O

that O

is O

larger O

uh O

it O

three I-QUANTITY

then O
we O

were O
a O

people O
going O
into O

out O

the O

would O

the O

let O
me O
play O
this O
piece O
of O
sound O
from O
one S-CARDINAL
of O
the O
passengers O
who O
was O
uh O
staying O
right O
nearby O
uh O
this O
particular O
uh O
room O
/. O

We O
were O
awakened O
uh O
about B-TIME
four I-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning E-TIME
uh O
by O
loud O
yelling O
coming O
from O
the O
cabin O
/. O

Um O
it O
sounded O
like O
people O
uh O
cheering O
uh O
like O
a O
drinking O
contest O
type O
thing O
/. O

And O
he O
says O
uh O
later O
um O
chief O
that O
he O
heard O
a O
horrific O
thud O
/. O

Well O
yeah O
that O
would O
indicate O
that O
something O
did O
go O
on O
there O
/. O

and O
we O
know O
uh O
that O
the O
three S-CARDINAL
individuals O
were O
in O
a O
room O
uh O
with O
Mister O
Smith S-PERSON
/. O

And O
the O
question O
that O
has O
to O
be O
uh O
presented O
to O
everybody O
is O
why O
is O
it O
taking O
so O
long O
for O
authorities O
to O
interview O
the O
individual O
that O
was O
in O
a O
cabin O
next O
door O
/? O

Mhm O
/. O

Any O
seasoned O
investigator O
would O
know O
that O
you O
would O
want O
to O
conduct O
your O
interviews O
uh O
of O
possible O
witnesses O
immediately O
after O
the O
crime O
/. O

Yeah O
/. O

Yeah O
/. O

And O
you O
would O
not O
just O
interview O
that O
individual O
next O
door O
/. O

You O
would O
have O
to O
take O
a O
step O
to O
interview O
people O
above O
below O
and O
to O
both O
sides O
/. O

Susan S-PERSON
what O
's O
the O
answer O
to O
that O
/? O

But O
Dan S-PERSON
/. O

there O
are O
jurisdictional O
problems O
here O
/. O

You O
know O
it O
's O
not O
a O
clear O
cut O
case O
as O
to O
who O
gets O
to O
prosecute O
this O
case O
/. O

Turkey S-GPE
ca O
n't O
do O
anything O
without O
a O
body O
/. O

United B-GPE
States E-GPE
can O
/. O

Fair O
play O
of O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States E-GPE
for O
stepping O
in O
/. O

fair O
play O
to O
law O
enforcement O
for O
getting O
involved O
/. O

Jurisdiction O
is O
n't O
clear O
/. O

but O
they O
're O
working O
very O
hard O
to O
solve O
the O
crime O
/. O

I O
do O
n't O
think O
the O
criticism O
is O
well O
placed O
against O
law O
enforcement O
in O
this O
case O
/. O

Also O
the O
crime O
scene O
oh O
if O
you O
want O
to O
call O
it O
that O
was O
cleaned O
up O
by O
the O
cruise O
ship O
who O
got O
their O
investigators O
and O
their O
lawyers O
in O
from O
what O
I O
understand O
right O
away O
to O
make O
this O
go O
away O
/. O

so O
I O
think O
law O
enforcement O
was O
put O
in O
a O
bad O
position O
trying O
to O
play O
catchup O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
they O
're O
doing O
+an O
amazing O
job O
/. O

Larry S-PERSON
so O
uh O
any O
chance O
now O
based O
on O
the O
fact O
that O
things O
have O
been O
cleaned O
up O
et O
cetera O
to O
get O
any O
usable O
evidence O
/? O

Well O
it O
's O
very O
difficult O
Dan S-PERSON
/. O

Uh O
obviously O
as O
we O
keep O
saying O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
body O
/. O

therefore O
we O
do O
not O
have O
a O
cause O
or O
a O
manner O
of O
the O
death O
/. O

But O
we O
do O
have O
some O
physical O
evidence O
/. O

Unfortunately O
examination O
of O
the O
photograph O
uh O
tells O
me O
it O
was O
not O
done O
the O
proper O
way O
/. O

It O
was O
n't O
a O
forensic O
photograph O
/. O

So O
I O
really O
do O
not O
know O
how O
large O
the O
stain O
was O
in O
its O
dimensions O
/. O

but O
it O
is O
pretty O
clear O
that O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
blood O
there O
great O
deal O
of O
blood O
/. O

It O
makes O
you O
think O
that O
something O
criminal O
occured O
/. O

But O
again O
getting O
back O
to O
how O
you O
solve O
the O
crime O
you O
got O
to O
go O
to O
the O
crime O
scene O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
there O
are O
multiple O
scenes O
here O
/. O

Every O
place O
there O
's O
blood O
it O
's O
a O
crime O
scene O
/. O

But O
the O
most O
important O
place O
is O
the O
cabin O
because O
that O
's O
presumably O
where O
the O
injury O
took O
place O
/. O

Now O
there O
was O
some O
rumor O
about O
some O
arguments O
going O
casino O
the B-TIME
night I-TIME
before E-TIME
/. O

Uh O
and O
it O
could O
very O
well O
be O
that O
he O
was O
arguing O
with O
these O
individuals O
/. O

so O
uh O
that O
could O
be O
the O
tie O
the O
connection O
/. O

and O
I O
think O
good O
policework O
would O
connect O
the O
individuals O
in O
question O
with O
the O
casino O
with O
Mister O
Smith S-PERSON
/. O

and O
that O
might O
help O
us O
understand O
what O
happened O
/. O

this O
is O
um O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
sound O
/. O

This O
is O
again O
from O
Cletus B-PERSON
Hyman E-PERSON
uh O
who O
was O
literally O
um O
in O
a O
joining O
or O
nearby O
cabin O
um O
as O
to O
what O
he O
heard O
around O
he O
said O
four B-TIME
in I-TIME
the I-TIME
morning E-TIME
the B-DATE
day E-DATE
before O
uh O
Mister O
Smith S-PERSON
went O
missing O
/. O

At O
times O
it O
sounded O
like O
furniture O
was O
being O
actually O
picked O
up O
and O
dropped O
/. O

and O
then O
that O
horrific O
uh O
thud O
/. O

Yeah O
I O
mean O
that O
sure O
sounds O
to O
me O
chief O
like O
we O
're O
not O
talking O
about O
someone O
who O
/- O

I O
mean O
I O
guess O
it O
's O
possible O
if O
you O
're O
talking O
about O
loud O
yelling O
coming O
/- O

Well O
look O
if O
this O
guy O
's O
right O
that O
loud O
yelling O
is O
coming O
from O
the O
cabin O
right O
and O
the O
wife O
is O
not O
a O
real O
suspect O
here O
means O
that O
there O
was O
probably O
someone O
else O
in O
there O
/. O

Well O
there O
absolutely O
was O
someone O
else O
in O
that O
room O
/. O

And O
what O
's O
interesting O
is O
there O
was O
a O
witness O
who O
uh O
had O
informed O
ship O
's O
authorities O
that O
she O
had O
heard O
a O
scream O
uh O
early B-TIME
that I-TIME
morning E-TIME
/. O

And O
what O
's O
really O
interesting O
is O
uh O
we O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
she O
's O
been O
interviewed O
at O
this O
point O
/. O

But O
it O
was O
five B-DATE
days I-DATE
later E-DATE
that O
the O
ship O

attorneys O
had O
begun O
to O
question O
her O

Alright O
Erin S-PERSON
let O
me O
start O
with O
you O

What O
do O
you O
think O
the O
biggest O
problem O
is O
out O
there O
when O
it O
comes O
to O
these O
sex O
offenders O
/? O

Well O
I O
think O
that O
there O
's O
a O
gross O
misconception O
about O
sex O
offender O
crimes O
/. O

I O
think O
most O
do O
not O
realize O
how O
pervasive O
the O
problem O
is O
/. O

The O
sex O
offenders O
that O
we O
have O
caught O
are O
a O
very O
small O
percentage O
of O
those O
that O
are O
out O
there O

Statistically O
one S-CARDINAL
in O
four S-CARDINAL

as O
many O
as O
one S-CARDINAL

six S-CARDINAL

ten S-CARDINAL

are O

they O
are O
eighteen S-DATE

That O
's O
nationwide O

This O
problem O
is O
much O
bigger O
than O
I O
think O
people O
are O
realizing O
/. O

And O
Linda S-PERSON
I O
guess O
what O
we O
're O
realizing O
as O
we O
have O
been O
highlighting O
these O
wanted O
sex O
offenders O
around O
the O
country O
is O
how O
many O
of O
them O
are O
still O
out O
there O
and O
wanted O

Well O
currently O
there O
's O
um O
right O
now O
uh O
over B-CARDINAL
a I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL

are O

Unbelievable O

Uh O
we O
know O
that O
there O
's O
over B-CARDINAL
five I-CARDINAL
hundred I-CARDINAL
thousand E-CARDINAL

So O
yes O
there O
's O
a O
vast O
amount O
that O
are O
running O
uh O
through O
the O

That O
's O
a O
May B-DATE
of I-DATE
two I-DATE
thousand I-DATE
five E-DATE
um O
statistic O
/. O

but O
as O
far O
as O
those O
before O
that O

/. O

Um O
Linda S-PERSON
eh O
how O
much O
has O
this O
eh O
when O
I O
say O
changed O
your O
life O
I O
mean O
in O
addition O
to O
the O
obvious O
loss O
of O
your O

in O
terms O
of O
what O
you O
are O
doing O
everyday O
with O
your O
life O
/. O

both O
of O
you O
have O
devoted O
much O
of O
your O

to O
this O
cause O
now O

Linda S-PERSON
why O
do O
n't O
you O
tell O
me O
a O
little O
bit O
about O
what O
you O
've O
been O
doing O

Well O
um O
I O
've O
been O
working O
with O

pardon O
me O

I O

it O

uh O

more O

The O

No O

In O

also O
begin O
on O
a O
cross-sea O

connecting O
Hong B-GPE

the O
two S-CARDINAL

It O

extremely O
troublesome O
to O
get O
there O
via O

One O
has O
to O
go O
up O
to O
Shenzhen S-GPE

Dongguan S-GPE

then O
go O
through O
Panyu S-GPE

keep O
going O
up O

and O
certainly O
go O

then O
pass O

For O

boldly O
made O
a O

With O

the O

would O
be O
very O

only O
a B-QUANTITY

However O
, O
due O

was O
put O
off O

This O

what O
we O

Anticipated O

With O
this O

that O

leads O

all O
three S-GPE
places O
, O
Hong B-GPE
Kong E-GPE
, O
Macao S-GPE
, O
and O
Zhuhai S-GPE
, O
basically O
, O
at O
the O
start O
of O
the O
bridge O
, O
you O
can O
get O
on O
the O
separate O
road O
to O
the O
place O
you O
want O
to O
go O
. O

Macao S-GPE
is O
this O
way O
, O
and O
Zhuhai S-GPE
is O
this O
way O
. O

From O
the O
perspective O
of O
either O
Hong B-GPE

, O
Macao S-GPE

or O
Zhuhai S-GPE
, O
our O

it O
was O
conferred O
on O
him O
, O
so O
only O
then O
-- O

OK O
, O
we O
'll O
call O
him O
General O
Ye B-PERSON
Ting E-PERSON
. O

Mm O
. O



Because O
, O

Very O
naughty O
? O

To O
what O
extent O
were O
you O
naughty O
then O
? O

In O
fact O
I O
was O
a O
very O
well O
- O
behaved O
child O
. O

But O
I O
was O
, O
forced O
into O
it O
, O
, O
if O
you O
were O
n't O
naughty O
there O
was O
no O
way O
to O
survive O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
forced O
into O
it O
? O

During O
the B-EVENT
Cultural I-EVENT
Revolution E-EVENT
, O
, O
um O
, O
my O
family O
was O
considered O
capitalist O
roaders O
. O

So O
the O
kids O
then O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
play O
with O
you O
, O
or O
they O
would O
tease O
you O
, O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
you O
always O
had O
to O
be O
fighting O
with O
people O
, O
such O
things O
, O

Why O
was O
that O
? O

Was O
it O
because O
people O
for O
example O
would O
say O
that O
your O
father O
was O
such O
and O
such O
, O
or O
your O
family O
was O
such O
and O
such O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
it O
was O
because O
of O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
? O

Right O
, O
the O
majority O
of O
it O
was O
like O
that O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

Because O
you O
had O
to O
face O
them O
alone O
, O
OK O
, O
a O
dozen S-CARDINAL
people O
who O
wanted O
to O
fight O
you O
. O

You O
had O
to O
show O
your O
stuff O
right O
off O
the O
bat O
, O
and O
you O
had O
to O
be O
tough O
. O

So O
that O
was O
, O
the O
only O
way O
you O
could O
overcome O
them O
and O
get O
the O
upper O
hand O
. O

Mm O
. O

Were O
you O
tough O
? O

Mm O
. O

Very O
tough O
. O

Tough O
enough O
to O
-- O

Because O
, O
there O
was O
no O
way O
, O
if O
you O
were O
n't O
tough O
that O
was O
it O
, O
, O
how O
could O
you O
manage O
. O

You O
were O
the O
son O
of O
capitalist O
roaders O
, O
, O
you O
thought O
it O
was O
natural O
to O
be O
the O
object O
of O
bullying O
, O
and O
it O
's O
perfectly O
normal O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
I O
remember O
one O
time O
, O
we O
were O
digging O
out O
an O
air O
- O
raid O
shelter O
, O
that O
-- O

Those O
, O
good O
kids O
, O
they O
went O
there O
and O
threw O
stones O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
dare O
defend O
myself O
, O
so O
I O
just O
had O
to O
endure O
it O
for O
quite O
a O
while O
. O

Mm O
. O

Finally O
a O
very O
big O
rock O
, O
a O
lump O
of O
earth O
, O
hit O
me O
on O
the O
head O
, O
And O
I O
got O
angry O
, O
so O
angry O
that O
I O
rushed O
out O
with O
a O
shovel O
and O
hit O
them O
with O
the O
shovel O
. O

Where O
did O
the O
shovel O
come O
from O
? O

From O
digging O
the O
air O
- O
raid O
shelter O
, O
it O
was O
there O
, O
right O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
you O
picked O
up O
the O
shovel O
and O
rushed O
them O
. O

Did O
you O
crack O
somebody O
's O
head O
open O
? O

Mm O
, O
anyhow O
, O
yes O
, O
I O
cracked O
their O
head O
open O
, O
it O
was O
very O
tragic O
. O

All O
of O
a O
sudden O
nobody O
was O
making O
a O
sound O
. O

Very O
-- O

Once O
I O
fought O
back O
, O
for O
several B-DATE
years E-DATE
after O
nobody O
dared O
mess O
with O
me O
. O

How O
many O
of O
them O
did O
you O
take O
out O
? O

I O
hit O
one O
of O
them O
and O
that O
was O
enough O
. O

Nopbody O
went O
to O
get O
the O
schoolmaster O
or O
somebody O
's O
father O
? O

They O
did O
, O
and O
there O
was O
a O
huge O
fuss O
. O

Mm O
. O

Because O
when O
I O
was O
little O
, O
having O
a O
big O
fight O
like O
that O
. O

Mm O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
more O
or O
less O
, O
, O
on O
average O
, O
every O
two S-CARDINAL
years O
I O
changed O
school O
, O
and O
that O
's O
how O
it O
had O
to O
be O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
remember O
one O
time O
-- O
Mm O
, O
also O
, O
when O
I O
was O
in O
fifth S-ORDINAL
or O
sixth S-ORDINAL
grade O
, O
someone O
yelled O
out O
, O
Down O
with O
Ye B-PERSON
Zhengming E-PERSON
, O
he O
was O
yelling O
at O
me O
, O
and O
I O
had O
to O
fight O
them O
. O

Mm O
. O

After O
the O
fight O
I O
went O
home O
, O
and O
my O
father O
was O
standing O
far O
away O
. O

, O
the O
factory O
, O
, O
on O
the O
street O
, O
somebody O
had O
written O
in O
huge O
letters O
Down O
with O
Ye B-PERSON
Zhengming E-PERSON
, O
, O
the O
slogan O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
got O
accustomed O
to O
it O
while O
passing O
by O
at O
that O
time O
, O
and O
now O
when O
I O
think O
about O
it O
, O
it O
seems O
very O
much O
like O
a O
stage O
play O
. O

Mm O
. O

Back O
then O
I O
felt O
, O
looking O
at O
him O
standing O
so O
far O
away O
-- O

I O
walked O
over O
to O
him O
, O
and O
he O
said O
, O
um O
, O
you O
really O
do O
n't O
understand O
anything O
. O

At O
the O
time O
I O
felt O
like O
I O
had O
a O
grievance O
. O

And O
I O
felt O
, O
I O
was O
fighting O
for O
you O
, O
the O
people O
were O
cursing O
you O
, O
and O
I O
was O
fighting O
them O
. O

In O
fact O
that O
's O
the O
way O
kids O
think O
. O

Mm O

Ok O

that O
's O
all O
right O
, O
let O

This O
is O
a O
movie O
directed O
by O
Ye S-PERSON
, O
called O
There B-WORK_OF_ART
's I-WORK_OF_ART
a I-WORK_OF_ART
Place I-WORK_OF_ART
Called I-WORK_OF_ART
Wangjiazhan E-WORK_OF_ART
. O

Wangjiazhuang S-GPE
, O
right O
. O

This O
is O
obviously O
him O
as O
a O
boy O
, O
uh O
, O
a O
memory O
of O
his O
childhood O
life O
. O

Right O
. O

Right O
. O

Which O
child O
is O
you O
. O

Is O
this O
child O
you O
, O
or O
is O
that O
child O
you O
? O

Actually O
we O
should O
be O
accurate O
; O
this O
child O
's O
experiences O
, O

So O
this O
child O
, O

Um O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
because O
once O
, O
I O

My O
father O
was O
denounced O
, O
and O
then O
the O
rebels O
took O
us O
, O
took O
that O
child O
to O
see O
. O

Mm O
. O

They O
denounced O
my O
father O
, O
so O
I O
was O
very O
indignant O
, O

They O
let O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
expose O
my O
father O
, O

Mm O
. O

Then O
the B-DATE
day E-DATE
after O
I O
took O
a O
kitchen O
knife O
and O
ran O
over O
to O
their O
home O
, O
that O
research O
institute O
, O
the O
doorway O
and O
vowed O
that O
I O
'd O
hack O
the O
guy O
up O
. O

A O
kitchen O
knife O
; O
a O
knife O
from O
your O
kitchen O
at O
home O
. O

Oh O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
a O
knife O
from O
my O
kitchen O
at O
home O
. O

Then O
I O
was O
standing O
there O
, O
lots O
of O
people O
surrounding O
me O
, O
and O
in O
fact O
you O
ca O
n't O
just O
hack O
people O
up O
. O

But O
I O
had O
already O
said O
it O
. O

What O
did O
you O
say O
? O

said O
I O
have O
to O
hack O
him O
, O
have O
to O
hack O
, O
so O
it O
was O
more O
or O
less O
like O
this O
child O
. O

But O
, O
those O
adults O
standing O
around O
reasoned O
with O
me O
, O
said O
look O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
understand O
this O
. O

If O
you O
do O
this O
, O
you O
'll O
stir O
up O
more O
trouble O
, O
and O
then O
wo O
n't O
your O
dad O
be O
even O
worse O
off O
? O

In O
fact O
when O
they O
said O
that O
, O
my O
mind O
had O
already O
eased O
. O

I O
could O
not O
lose O
the O
face O
this O
way O
, O
, O
So O
then O
I O
ran O
over O
and O
took O
a O
whack O
at O
the O
door O
, O
to O
get O
an O
excuse O
for O
myself O
. O

Was O
it O
all O
ruined O
? O
The O
door O
-- O

I O
slashed O
it O
twice O
. O

Um O
, O
was O
n't O
there O
any O
consequence O
? O

Mm O
, O
there O
was O
no O
consequence O
, O
, O
I O
just O
let O
the O
adults O
reason O
with O
me O
. O

Mm O
, O
and O
this O
is O
a O
memory O
from O
your O
childhood O
years O
. O

It O
, O
had O
a O
great O
influence O
on O
me O
. O

Including O
that O
village O
, O
that O
environment O
, O
it O
's O
all O
very O
familiar O
to O
you O
. O

More O
or O
less O
, O
very O
close O
to O
me O
, O
this O
is O
a O
novel O
of O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
the O
reason O
I O
like O
it O
is O
because O
, O
um O
, O
it O
brings O
up O
lots O
of O
that O
kind O
of O
childhood O
memories O
. O

Mm O
, O
you O
spent O
a O
large O
part O
of O
your O
childhood O
in O
Beijing S-GPE
. O

What O
year O
was O
it O
that O
you O
moved O
to O
Shanghai S-GPE
? O

How O
old O
were O
you O
at O
that O
time O
? O

, O
In O
'69 S-DATE
I O
was O
11 B-DATE
years E-DATE
old O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
well O
. O

In O
'69 S-DATE
at O
the O
age O
of O
11 S-DATE
you O
went O
from O
Beijing S-GPE
to O
Shanghai S-GPE
. O

Mm O
, O
your O
living O
environment O
changed O
, O
but O
perhaps O
that O
mischievousness O
had O
n't O
completely O
passed O
. O

Mm O
, O
as O
he O
puts O
it O
, O
looking O
at O
it O
now O
, O
some O
of O
the O
memories O
can O
be O
very O
painful O
, O
but O
it O
was O
pretty O
happy O
days O
. O

I O
went O
there O
every O
day O
and O
then O
they O
suspended O
classes O
, O
, O
so O
I O
could O
n't O
go O
to O
school O
, O
could O
n't O
go O
to O
class O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
, O
later O
I O
remember O
there O
was O
-- O
Mm O
. O
A O
guy O
in O
the O
engineering O
team O
, O
and O
he O
brought O
Quotations B-WORK_OF_ART
from I-WORK_OF_ART
Chairman I-WORK_OF_ART
Mao E-WORK_OF_ART
and O
said O
to O
me O
, O
He O
said O
, O
now O
take O
this O
, O
now O
take O
these O
Quotations B-WORK_OF_ART
from I-WORK_OF_ART
Chairman I-WORK_OF_ART
Mao E-WORK_OF_ART
and O
teach O
yourselves O
, O
and O
in O
the O
future O
you O
'll O
take O
up O
arms O
and O
teach O
yourselves O
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
very O
happy O
, O
very O
excited O
, O
because O
they O
were O
bringing O
back O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
, O
why O
were O
you O
feeling O
so O
depressed O
? O

Right O
, O
but O
the O
problem O
-- O

Because O
, O
I O
had O
never O
studied O
well O
, O



In O
1966 S-DATE
the B-EVENT
Great I-EVENT
Cultural I-EVENT
Revolution E-EVENT
came O
, O
and O
at O
that O
time O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON

family O
moved O
from O
Beijing S-GPE
to O
Shanghai S-GPE
to O
live O
. O

His O
father O
Ye B-PERSON
Zhengming E-PERSON
was O
being O
criticized O
as O
a O
capitalist O
roader O
at O
the O
research O
institute O
, O
and O
the O
political O
situation O
was O
getting O
worse O
by O
the O
day O
. O

And O
the O
change O
of O
regions O
did O
nothing O
to O
change O
the O
violent O
nature O
of O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
's E-PERSON
life O
. O

He O
was O
still O
struggling O
at O
the O
edge O
of O
preserving O
justice O
. O

When O
you O
got O
to O
Shanghai S-GPE
the O
environment O
changed O
; O
did O
n't O
your O
whole O
person O
change O
? O

After O
I O
got O
to O
Shanghai S-GPE
, O
, O
settling O
into O
, O
, O
that O
, O

All O
that O
time O
, O
from O
'69 S-DATE
to O
'76 S-DATE
, O
I O
graduated O
from O
senior O
middle O
school O
, O
it O
all O
took O
place O
there O
. O

Mm O
. O

At O
that O
time O
in O
school O
, O
there O
were O
some O
special O
children O
, O
there O
was O
a O
special O
class O
, O
the O
better O
students O
, O
were O
you O
in O
that O
class O
? O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
, O
see O
, O
like O
study O
classes O
to O
educate O
good O
kids O
. O

What O
kind O
of O
people O
were O
in O
your O
class O
? O

Um O
. O

Anyhow O
, O
boys O
and O
girls O
who O
did O
not O
perform O
well O
, O
you O
could O
say O
they O
were O
little O
hooligans O
, O
they O
were O
all O
mixed O
in O
together O
in O
that O
class O
, O
and O
there O
were O
also O
some O
who O
had O
problems O
at O
home O
. O

Mm O
. O

All O
of O
them O
, O
and O
every O
day O
I O
went O
there O
, O
and O
the O
classes O
were O
suspended O
, O
, O
so O
they O
did O
n't O
let O
me O
go O
to O
school O
, O
did O
n't O
let O
me O
go O
to O

. O

Mm O

So O
, O
afterward O
, O
I O

there O
was O
Mm O

A O
guy O
in O
the O

Mm O
. O

So O
I O
was O
with O
this O
group O
of O
kids O
all O
together O
, O
and O
everybody O
copied O
everybody O
else O
and O
it O
was O
even O
harder O
to O
study O
. O

In O
fact O
it O
was O
n't O
that O
we O
did O
n't O
study O
, O
I O
think O
it O
was O
, O

This O
class O
really O
helped O
me O
a O
lot O
, O
, O
sometimes O
in O
my O
life O
I O
think O
about O
this O
, O

Mm O
. O

That O
period O
was O
both O
a O
happy O
and O
a O
fun O
time O
. O

Because O
I O
was O
a O
good O
egg O
. O

In O
this O
I O
go O
against O
the O
grain O
. O

Um O
, O
the O
thing O
is O
, O
, O
they O
're O
all O
the O
same O
. O

If O
you O
're O
bad O
, O
you O
do O
what O
you O
want O
, O
and O
so O
, O
you O
're O
honest O
and O
so O
it O
's O
easy O
to O
be O
free O
. O

Plus O
when O
you O
yourself O
have O
already O
decided O
that O
you O
're O
a O
bad O
kid O
, O
then O
, O
you O
achieve O
a O
kind O
of O
liberation O
, O
and O
you O
're O
completely O
liberated O
and O
free O
. O

I O
think O
that O
-- O

Um O
, O
of O
course O
today S-DATE
we O
say O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
um O
, O
in O
that O
class O
of O
ours O
, O
they O
were O
n't O
all O
necessarily O
bad O
kids O
. O

Mm O
. O

They O
just O
were O
n't O
like O
normal O
kids O
. O

, O
it O
was O
like O
a O
brotherhood O
. O

Ah O
, O
and O
we O
did O
some O
things O
that O
were O
out O
of O
bounds O
. O

Mm O
, O
we O
helped O
each O
other O
. O

Very O
sincere O
, O
very O
sincere O
and O
good O
. O



When O
he O
was O
in O
that O
class O
, O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
received O
patient O
teaching O
every O
day O
. O

At O
that O
time O
he O
encountered O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
love O
of O
his O
life O
that O
still O
remains O
fresh O
in O
his O
memory O
. O

This O
girl O
became O
the O
only O
light O
in O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
's E-PERSON
dark O
life O
for O
several B-DATE
years E-DATE
. O

In O
those O
days O
if O
a O
middle O
school O
student O
liked O
a O
fellow O
- O
student O
, O
how O
did O
he O
go O
about O
expressing O
that O
? O

Um O
. O

When O
I O
was O
a O
school O
kid O
, O
for O
example O
, O
Um O
, O
that O
girl O
, O
who O
ran O
the O
kitchen O
and O
was O
one O
of O
the O
better O
students O
in O
our O
class O
, O
I O
liked O
her O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
always O
felt O
, O
um O
, O
she O
can O
, O
give O
you O
more O
on O
your O
plate O
, O
put O
more O
things O
on O
your O
plate O
for O
you O
to O
eat O
. O

And O
then O
the O
most O
obvious O
way O
was O
um O
, O
to O
go O
see O
a O
movie O
together O
. O

Mm O
. O

It O
was O
, O

So O
already O
you O
could O
-- O
Go O
see O
a O
movie O
; O
I O
thought O
, O

That O
was O
it O
, O
that O
was O
it O
. O

You O
just O
want O
to O
go O
see O
the O
movie O
, O
you O
do O
n't O
worry O
about O
holding O
hands O
or O
not O
, O
um O
, O
and O
that O
was O
great O
, O
-- O

So O
you O
went O
to O
the O
movies O
with O
this O
girl O
? O

Yes O
. O

Do O
you O
still O
remember O
what O
movies O
you O
saw O
? O

The B-WORK_OF_ART
Flower I-WORK_OF_ART
Girl I-WORK_OF_ART
. E-WORK_OF_ART

I O
still O
remember O
that O
now O
. O

Mm O
. O

She O
cried O
as O
hard O
as O
she O
could O
. O

So O
seeing O
The B-WORK_OF_ART
Flower I-WORK_OF_ART
Girl E-WORK_OF_ART
was O
the O
equivalent O
of O
seeing O
Titanic S-WORK_OF_ART
now O
. O

Oh O
, O
yes O
, O
yes O
, O
a O
bit O
, O
a O
bit O
, O
yes O
, O
all O
was O
ready O
, O
no O
cry O
. O

Yes O
, O
crying O
her O
eyes O
out O
, O
a O
big O
film O
like O
that O
. O

At O
the O
time O
I O
thought O
I O
would O
n't O
cry O
. O

But O
the O
people O
all O
around O
were O
crying O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
if O
I O
did O
n't O
cry O
it O
would O
look O
bad O
. O

So O
then O
you O
cried O
. O

So O
then O
I O
thought O
, O
I O
should O
let O
my O
emotions O
go O
. O

Um O
, O
how O
was O
the O
girl O
, O
was O
she O
very O
pretty O
? O

, O
now O
I O
remember O
that O
she O
was O
very O
pretty O
, O
mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

She O
was O
a O
very O
good O
student O
. O

Ha O
ha O
, O
this O
-- O

How O
was O
it O
she O
liked O
you O
? O

At O
that O
time O
we O
did O
n't O
talk O
about O
it O
, O
if O
two S-CARDINAL
people O
gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
and O
felt O
it O
was O
right O
, O
then O
, O

Gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
, O
while O
you O
were O
in O
the O
class O
you O
gave O
each O
other O
the O
eye O
. O

, O
so O
, O
when O
we O
were O
in O
class O
, O
for O
example O
you O
, O

I O
remember O
how O
it O
happened O
, O
yes O
. O

Um O
. O
When O
we O
went O
to O
class O
, O
in O
the O
classroom O
, O
it O
was O
all O
very O
chaotic O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
then O
, O
we O
'd O
each O
pick O
up O
a O
piece O
of O
chalk O
and O
toss O
the O
chalk O
back O
and O
forth O
. O
And O
throw O
spitballs O
. O

I O
threw O
it O
at O
someone O
else O
but O
missed O
, O
and O
it O
hit O
her O
. O

The O
result O
was O
that O
she O
turned O
her O
head O
to O
look O
. O

And O
she O
looked O
at O
you O
angrily O
. O

I O
thought O
, O
uh-oh O
, O
the O
expression O
in O
her O
eyes O
was O
like O
she O
would O
forgive O
you O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
feeling O
. O

I O
thought O
wow O
, O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
feeling O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
's O
how O
it O
was O
, O
I O
should O
say O
. O

It O
was O
like O
that O
? O

Mm O
. O

Many B-DATE
years E-DATE
later O

the O

for O

In O
1976 S-DATE
, O
there O
were O
two S-CARDINAL
happy O
events O
in O
the O
Ye S-PERSON
family O
. O

The O
first S-ORDINAL
was O
that O
his O
father O
, O
Ye B-PERSON
Zhengming E-PERSON
, O
was O
released O
and O
reunited O
with O
his O
family O
that O
he O
had O
been O
separated O
from O

three B-DATE
years E-DATE
. O

The O
second S-ORDINAL
event O
was O
that O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
had O
his O
18th S-ORDINAL
birthday O
and O
became O
an O
adult O
. O

With O
the O
turn O
for O
the O
better O
in O
his O
father O
's O
political O
circumstances O
, O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
left O
behind O
his O
violent O
life O
and O
changed O
suddenly O
, O
becoming O
more O
inward O
- O
looking O
. O

In O
1978 S-DATE
the O
big O
news O
was O
that O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
would O
be O
reinstated O
nationwide O
, O
and O
people O
of O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying I-PERSON
's E-PERSON
age O
were O
thrilled O
. O

However O
, O
at O
this O
time O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
, O
facing O
this O
opportunity O
that O
would O
change O
his O
fortune O
, O
was O
at O
a O
loss O
as O
to O
what O
to O
do O
. O

You O
thought O
those O
days O
were O
pretty O
good O
, O
did O
you O
not O
think O
about O
getting O
into O
the O
university O
? O

Oh O
my O
, O
in O
fact O
, O
'78 S-DATE
, O
for O
me O
, O
was O
an O
especially O
depressing O
time O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

Up O
to O
then O
, O
um O
, O
I O
had O
never O
thought O
about O
the O
future O
. O

Mm O
. O

I O
thought O
everybody O
was O
the O
same O
, O
your O
fate O
settled O
things O
for O
you O
, O
um O
, O
you O
either O
go O
to O
a O
place O
live O
and O
work O
, O
or O
you O
became O
a O
-LRB- O
factory O
-RRB- O
worker O
. O

In O
society O
, O
being O
a O
worker O
was O
already O
not O
so O
bad O
a O
thing O
, O
um O
, O
a O
way O
to O
move O
ahead O
. O

Um O
, O
in O
'78 S-DATE
suddenly O
they O
reinstated O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
. O

At O
that O
time O
, O
in O
'78 S-DATE
, O
I O
was O
20 S-DATE
. O

A O
lot O
of O
people O
were O
happy O
, O
very O
excited O
, O
because O
they O
reinstated O
the O
college O
entrance O
exams O
; O
why O
were O
you O
feeling O
depressed O
? O

Right O
, O
but O
the O
problem O
was O
, O
, O
Because O
, O
I O
had O
never O
done O
well O
in O
school O
. O

So O
right O
off O
I O
felt O
that O
I O
was O
finished O
, O
-- O

Those O
kids O
who O
were O
younger O
than O
us O
who O
had O
done O
well O
in O
school O
, O
, O
compared O
to O
me O
, O
they O
had O
a O
future O
, O
um O
, O
they O
could O
stand O
out O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
I O
was O
hopeless O
, O
right O
off O
I O
was O
feeling O
down O
. O

Very O
clearly O
a O
-- O

If O
you O
wanted O
to O
take O
the O
exams O
, O
what O
kind O
of O
score O
did O
you O
think O
you O
'd O
get O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
take O
the O
exams O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
have O
the O
nerve O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
try O
, O
so O
-- O

, O
the O
extraordinary O
thing O
was O
, O
at O
that O
time O
my O
mom O
was O
attending O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
she O
was O
an O
instructor O
there O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
I O
had O
n't O
thought O
, O
, O
that O
I O
would O
work O
in O
the O
movie O
. O

Mm O
. O

, O
um O
, O
she O
wanted O
to O
send O
the O
recruitment O
announcement O
to O
a O
friend O
's O
house O
. O

Mm O
. O

So O
then O
I O
-- O

One O
day O
she O
sent O
me O
to O
deliver O
it O
, O
and O
so O
I O
picked O
it O
up O
and O
read O
it O
, O
and O
once O
I O
read O
it O
, O
oh O
! O
The O
directing O
department O
of O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
inside O
, O
no O
language O
exams O
, O
no O
math O
or O
physics O
or O
chemistry O
exams O
, O
and O
I O
thought O
wow O
! O
This O
is O
just O
the O
ticket O
. O

Let O
's O
run O
off O
to O
try O
and O
see O
. O

I O
thought O
you O
've O
loved O
movies O
ever O
since O
you O
were O
little O
, O
and O
then O
every O
day O
sitting O
in O
the O
movie O
theater O
you O
thought O
, O
I O
want O
to O
be O
a O
director O
. O

No O
, O
I O
did O
n't O
, O
no O
. O

It O
was O
just O
because O
there O
was O
no O
English S-LANGUAGE
exam O
, O
no O
exams O
in O
math O
or O
physics O
or O
chemistry O
. O

Right O
, O
it O
was O
very O
simple O
. O

Mm O
. O

One O
more O
thing O
, O
because O
in O
'78 S-DATE
, O
the B-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Institute E-ORG
was O
recruiting O
students O
in O
Shanghai S-GPE
-- O

Right O
. O

So O
, O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
went O
to O
take O
the O
exams O
for O
the O
film O
institute O
, O
but O
did O
n't O
pass O
the O
exams O
. O

His O
mother O
, O
An B-PERSON
Qi E-PERSON
, O
had O
never O
thought O
that O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
would O
sign O
up O
to O
take O
the O
exam O
for O
her O
work O
unit O
, O
the B-ORG
Beijing I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Institute E-ORG
. O

But O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
in O
fact O
failed O
when O
he O
took O
the O
reinstated O
exam O
. O

Although O
it O
was O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
he O
had O
taken O
the O
exam O
, O
it O
left O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
even O
more O
convinced O
that O
movies O
were O
something O
he O
could O
do O
. O

The B-DATE
next I-DATE
year E-DATE
, O
21 B-DATE
- I-DATE
year E-DATE
- O
old O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
passed O
the O
entrance O
exam O
for O
the O
actors O
training O
class O
at O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio E-ORG
. O

Being O
an O
actor O
was O
not O
his O
goal O
; O
he O
hoped O
rather O
to O
get O
into O
the O
directing O
profession O
. O

At O
that O
time O
you O
especially O
admired O
directors O
, O
right O
? O

Mm O
, O
because O
after O
I O
got O
to O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio E-ORG
, O
um O
, O
I O
discovered O
I O
had O
the O
shakes O
when O
I O
got O
on O
stage O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O
Now O
, O
here O
chatting O
with O
you O
, O
I O
feel O
, O
um O
, O
it O
does O
n't O
matter O
. O

Even O
today S-DATE
, O
in O
front O
of O
the O
lens O
, O
I O
'm O
a O
nervous O
wreck O
. O

Mm O
, O
very O
tense O
. O

Did O
you O
act O
then O
? O

Of O
course O
, O
every O
day O
we O
had O
to O
, O
um O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
just O
recitation O
, O
so O
, O
doing O
sketches O
, O
this O
and O
that O
. O

I O
thought O
, O
this O
is O
definitely O
not O
working O
. O

Just O
getting O
on O
stage O
gave O
you O
the O
shakes O
. O

Then O
, O
, O
no O
, O
it O
was O
n't O
my O
thing O
, O
this O
, O
I O
could O
n't O
find O
out O
why O
, O
and O
besides O
in O
those O
days O
, O

Um O
, O
it O
was O
in O
'80 S-DATE
that O
I O
went O
to O
the B-ORG
Xi'an I-ORG
Film I-ORG
Studio E-ORG
, O

Mm O

At O
that O
time O
, O
it O
was O
, O
always O
that O
kind O
of O
pompous O
stuff O
, O
or O
, O
that O
milquetoast O
kind O
of O
young O
male O
character O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

And O
I O
'm O
not O
that O
kind O
of O
person O
, O
so O
I O
could O
n't O
get O
my O
bearings O
. O

So O
then O
at O
the O
same O
time O
when O
I O
saw O
that B-PERSON
Teng I-PERSON
Wenji E-PERSON
, O
he O
was O
probably O
thirty B-DATE
- I-DATE
some I-DATE
years E-DATE
old O
, O
he O
was O
the O
previous O
generation O
to O
us O
, O
very O
stubborn O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
projecting O
force O
of O
his O
, O
I O
thought O
wow O
, O
, O
that O
's O
really O
good O
. O

He O
could O
really O
project O
. O

Because O
ultimately O
, O
there O
, O
I O
gradually O
realized O
this O
. O

Mm O
. O

And O
I O
would O
be O
in O
the O
audience O
and O
see O
him O
directing O
on O
site O
. O

Mm O
. O

Mm O
, O
I O
could O
see O
how O
they O
worked O
. O

In O
fact O
in O
the O
beginning O
the O
attraction O
to O
movies O
was O
all O
these O
things O
, O
I O
thought O
it O
was O
really O
a O
bunch O
of O
fluff O
, O
I O
thought O
, O
that O
's O
really O
fun O
, O
that O
's O
really O
interesting O
. O

I O
thought O
who O
was O
stubborn O
, O
then O
I O
wanted O
to O
be O
that O
kind O
of O
person O
, O
but O
that O
did O
n't O
mean O
I O
knew O
anything O
about O
that O
profession O
. O



So O
no O
one O
ever O
came O
looking O
for O
you O
to O
do O
a O
play O
? O

At O
that O
time O
-- O

Mm O
, O
no O
one O
ever O
came O
looking O
-- O
. O

They O
looked O
, O
but O
it O
was O
always O
just O
for O
an O
extra O
. O

, O
you O
did O
n't O
even O
have O
any O
lines O
. O

Mm O
. O

That O
Xi'an B-EVENT
Incident E-EVENT
thing O
, O
I O
played O
an O
extra O
once O
. O

There O
was O
a O
guy O
playing O
Zhang B-PERSON
Xueliang E-PERSON
, O
and O
I O
played O
his O
secretary O
going O
in O
to O
report O
to O
him O
, O
and O
I O
did O
it O
a O
few O
times O
but O
I O
was O
always O
in O
the O
wrong O
place O
. O

What O
were O
your O
lines O
supposed O
to O
be O
? O

It O
was O
" O
reporting O
, O
a O
telegram O
" O
that O
sort O
of O
thing O
. O

So O
you O
-- O

So O
I O
had O
never O
served O
as O
a O
soldier O
, O
that O
kind O
of O
pose O
, O
it O
was O
really O
awful O
. O

So O
after O
I O
gave O
that O
up O
, O
no O
, O
it O
was O
not O
that O
kind O
of O
thing O
. O

So O
the O
old O
director O
, O
Cheng B-PERSON
Yin E-PERSON
, O
um O
, O

Mm O
. O

He O
would O
say O
, O
this O
is O
An B-PERSON
Qi I-PERSON
's E-PERSON
son O
, O
why O
is O
he O
like O
that O
? O

Do O
you O
remember O
how O
many O
takes O
you O
did O
? O

Oh O
, O
a O
lot O
. O

I O
think O
it O
was O
something O
like O
ten B-CARDINAL
plus E-CARDINAL
times O
. O

It O
was O
too O
, O
I O
'd O
walk O
badly O
and O
turn O
like O
that O
. O

, O
I O
attended O
that O
class O
for O
half B-DATE
a I-DATE
year E-DATE
, O
um O
, O
um O
and O
then O
I O
got O
sick O
. O

Um O
, O
I O
got O
, O
, O
an O
inflammation O
of O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
, O
so O
my O
whole O
body O
was O
paralyzed O
. O

Your O
whole O
body O
was O
paralyzed O
? O

Right O
. O

Your O
whole O
body O
was O
paralyzed O
? O

Right O
. O
I O
was O
paralyzed O
for O
ten B-DATE
months E-DATE
. O

So O
you O
could O
n't O
move O
at O
all O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
move O
at O
all O
. O

When O
it O
started O
, O
my O
leg O
went O
numb O
, O
then O
my O
hand O
went O
numb O
, O
and O
then O
it O
started O
cross O
over O
, O
like O
that O
, O
and O
then O
slowly O
, O
slowly O
, O
slowly O
I O
could O
n't O
move O
. O

What O
's O
the O
scientific O
name O
of O
the O
disease O
? O

It O
's O
called O
Guillain O
- O
Barre O
Syndrome O
. O

It O
's O
named O
after O
a O
foreigner O
. O

Mm O
. O

Ahem O
, O
if O
naming O
it O
somewhat O
common O
, O
it O
's O
, O
a O
paralysis O
of O
the O
central O
nervous O
system O
, O
um O
, O
it O
goes O
from O
the O
nerve O
endings O
to O
the O
flesh O
, O
and O
, O
then O
it O
turns O
into O
myasthenia O
. O

And O
how O
did O
you O
get O
better O
, O
later O
? O

Hormones O
. O

You O
took O
hormones O
. O

Um O
, O
, O
every O
day O
I O
had O
a O
transfusion O
. O

Mm O
, O
after O
you O
get O
hormones O
, O
people O
may O
get O
very O
fat O
. O

Mm O
. O

Very O
fat O
. O

I O
'm O
so O
fat O
now O
, O
but O
compared O
to O
then O
it O
's O
much O
better O
, O
in O
fact O
. O

At O
that O
time O
how O
fat O
were O
you O
? O

Yah O
. O

Getting O
so O
fat O
, O
it O
was O
this O
, O
if O
I O
looked O
down O
I O
could O
see O
my O
own O
cheeks O
, O
so O
I O
thought O
I O
was O
really O
fat O
. O

What O
do O
you O
mean O
? O

If O
I O
just O
look O
down O
, O
my O
cheeks O
are O
right O
here O
. O

But O
after O
they O
finished O
with O
the O
hormones O
, O
I O
gradually O
got O
better O
. O

Mm O
. O

The O
flesh O
all O
atrophied O
, O
um O
. O

If O
you O
look O
at O
when O
I O
was O
in O
middle O
school O
, O
based O
on O
that O
bit O
of O
exercise O
-- O

Later O
, O
based O
on O
that O
, O
it O
all O
evaporated O
. O



I O
've O
heard O
it O
said O
that O
that O
Wang B-PERSON
Shuo E-PERSON
novel O
, O
which O
we O
later O
saw O
as O
a O
television O
play O
-- O

Sometimes O
, O
oh O
, O
right O
. O

Mm O
. O

Get O
some O
fun O
. O

Get O
some O
fun O
. O

The O
language O
in O
that O
, O
the O
part O
Wang B-PERSON
Zhiwen E-PERSON
played O
, O
the O
disease O
he O
got O
is O
about O
the O
same O
as O
your O
disease O
, O
is O
n't O
it O
? O

Right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
, O
right O
. O

So O
sometimes O
, O
oh O
, O
it O
was O
me O
and O
Wang B-PERSON
Shuo E-PERSON
, O
together O
, O
it O
was O
, O
um O
, O
in O
'89 S-DATE
. O

Mm O
, O
together O
, O
um O
, O
wrote O
a O
-- O
. O

Aye O
, O
the O
script O
I O
wanted O
, O
the O
novel O
he O
wrote O
, O
um O
, O
that O
piece O
we O
created O
together O
. O

Mm O
. O

Therefore O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
we O
were O
talking O
and O
talking O
to O
shoot O
, O
an O
urban O
love O
story O
, O
tell O
a O
love O
story O
, O
so O
he O
took O
me O
, O
at O
that O
time O
, O
, O
more O
or O
less O
that O
story O
, O
as O
background O
. O

Mm O
. O

Then O
after O
I O
went O
back O
to O
Beijning S-GPE
, O
when O
we O
made O
arrangement O
and O
were O
eating O
together O
, O
I O
saw O
Wang B-PERSON
Shuo E-PERSON
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O

Then O
, O
when O
I O
saw O
him O
for O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
time O
, O
Wang B-PERSON
Shuo E-PERSON
was O
holding O
a O
book O
in O
his O
arms O
, O
a O
book O
, O
that O
was O
Floating B-WORK_OF_ART
on I-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Sea E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
that O
novel O
he O
wrote O
, O
it O
was O
a O
sample O
. O

Mm O
. O

Gave O
it O
to O
me O
, O
and O
I O
took O
it O
back O
to O
school O
to O
read O
. O

I O
read O
it O
and O
wow O
, O
that O
day O
, O
I O
thought O
he O
would O
be O
able O
-- O

Our O
generation O
could O
really O
find O
ourselves O
, O
I O
mean O
-- O

Um O
, O
in O
the O
end O
I O
knew O
we O
-- O

Why O
we O
studied O
movies O
, O
um O
, O
and O
why O
wrote O
things O
, O
expressing O
one O
's O
own O
kind O
of O
thing O
is O
the O
most O
accurate O
person O

Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
had O
already O
read O
Wang B-PERSON
Shuo I-PERSON
's E-PERSON
novel O
Love B-WORK_OF_ART
the I-WORK_OF_ART
Hard I-WORK_OF_ART
Way E-WORK_OF_ART
, O
and O
the O
story O
and O
the O
style O
it O
was O
written O
in O
made O
a O
profound O
impression O
on O
him O
. O

He O
sighed O
, O
this O
expresses O
what O
our O
generation O
really O
wants O
to O
express O
. O

Later O
he O
was O
introduced O
by O
a O
friend O
, O
and O
Ye B-PERSON
Daying E-PERSON
met O
the O
author O
of O
the O
novel O
, O
Wang B-PERSON
Shuo E-PERSON
, O
at O
the O
film O
institute O
. O

That O
was O
the O
beginning O
of O
their O
long O
friendship O
, O
which O
continues O
today S-DATE
. O

How O
many O
plays O
did O
you O
collaborate O
on O
? O




Unbelievable O
. O

yeah O

things O
are O
g- O

%eh O
%eh O
thank O
God O

very O
very O
happy O

Very O
nice O

%uh O

I O
'm O
still O
hanging O
out O
at O
Westinghouse S-ORG
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
have O
your O
hat O
. O

I O
wear O
your O
hat O
all O
the O
time O
. O

oh O
goo- O

I O
thought O
you O
know O
it O
's O
a O
good O
hat O
man O
. O

I O
sent O
that O
to O
you O
with O
all O
%uh O
good O
intents O
. O

I O
hope O
you O
appreciate O
it O
. O

I O
do O
. O

I O
wear O
it O
all O
the O
time O
. O

okay O
. O

%uh O
%uh O
I O
hope O
I O
have O
%um O
a O
picture O
of O
myself O
when O
I O
%uh O
had O
reserves O
. O
you O
know O
the O
other O
month O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

I O
took O
a O
picture O
%uh O
with O
me O

and O
I O
hope O
it O
comes O
out O
. O

I O
'll O
send O
it O
to O
you O
. O

Thank O
you O
very O
much O
. O

%um O

If O
it O
does O
n't O
I O
'll O
take O
another O
picture O
. O

Let O
's O
see O
%uh O

Go O
ahead O
. O

Well O
I O
'm O
still O
working O
there O
you O
know O

and O
%uh O
I O
'm O
on O
a O
pretty O
good O
project O
. O

Right O
. O

a O
long O
term O
%uh O
next O
generation O
%uh O
fighter O
plane O
. O

Really O
? O

So O
that O
's O
%uh O
kind O
of O
good O
experience O
I O
guess O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
%uh O
Westinghouse S-ORG
supposedly O
is O
making O
a O
bid O
to O
buy O
the O
%uh O
C O
B O
S O
broadcasting O
network O
. O

I O
thought O
they O
bought O
them O
already O
. O

Well O
, O
you O
know O
, O
it O
takes O
months O
to O
close O
a O
deal O

so O
there O
's O
-- O
%ah O
. O
-- O
lots O
of O
speculation O
-- O
Right O
. O
-- O
that O
they O
'll O
have O
to O
sell O
the O
%uh O
electronics O
division O
in O
order O
to O
do O
that O
. O

and O
what O
would O
happen O
with O
you O
? O

I O
guess O
we O
'd O
be O
sold O
to O
another O
company O
and O
see O
what O
happens O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

mhm O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
too O
concerned O
about O
it O
though O

but O
it O
's O
a O
possibility O
. O

But O
you O
have O
a O
senior O
position O
there O
. O

Well O
, O
I O
suppose O
so O
. O

But O
, O
you O
know O
. O
They O
do O
n't O
really O
think O
of O
it O
that O
way O

they O
just O
look O
at O
the O
numbers O
how O
many O
people O
they O
want O
and O
how O
many O
people O
they O
have O
. O

It O
's O
just O
a O
business O
. O

Right O
. O

they O
just O
get O
rid O
of O
what O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%uh O
that O
's O
still O
going O
pretty O
well O
. O

%huh O

nothing O
really O
new O
with O
the O
house O
or O
anything O

We O
've O
had O
some O
interesting O
incidents O
with O
wasps O
that O
have O
%uh O
been O
invading O
the O
neighborhood O
. O

they O
built O
a O
nest O
in O
my O
rafters O
of O
my O
house O
and O
busted O
through O
. O

But O
I O
told O
you O
about O
that O
, O
I O
think O
. O

I O
got O
a O
in O
the O
mail O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
that O

Well O
I O
wanted O
to O
ask O
you O
what O
's O
with O
the O
school O
? O

The O
schools O
are O
extremely O
expensive O
. O

I O
'm O
going O
broke O
basically O
doing O
that O
. O

And O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
%uh O
handle O
that O
. O

But O
how O
come O
they O
do O
n't O
help O
you O
? O

It O
does O
n't O
make O
a O
difference O
. O

you O
're O
still O
going O
to O
go O
broke O
whether O
they O
help O
you O
or O
not O
. O

They O
're O
not O
going O
to O
let O
you O
run O
a O
profit O
when O
you O
're O
on O
scholarship O
. O

if O
you O
have O
two B-MONEY
thousand I-MONEY
dollars E-MONEY
at O
the B-DATE
end I-DATE
of I-DATE
the I-DATE
year E-DATE
they O
're O
not O
going O
to O
say O
oh O
well O
%uh O
I O
guess O
you O
can O
have O
that O
. O

They O
're O
going O
to O
make O
you O
pay O
everything O
. O

Wait O
a O
minute O

I O
'm O
talking O
about O

wait O

wait O
fir- O

I O
'm O
talking O
about O
your O
schooling O
. O

My O
schooling O

I O
thought O
you O
meant O
the O
kids O
' O
school O
. O

My O
schooling O
? O

yeah O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O

on O
hold O
all O
the O
time O
. O

took O
a O
course O
last O
semester O

I O
have O
n't O
signed O
up O
yet O
for O
the O
fall O

It O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
stress O

It O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
stress O
. O

trying O
to O

you O
know O
you O
put O
out O
a O
lot O
of O
money O

and O
you O
have O
to O
work O
really O
hard O
to O
get O
it O
back O
. O

Right O
. O

there O
's O
not O
necessarily O
any O
benefit O
to O
it O
either O
. O

So O

%hm O
. O



sorry O
I O
was O
talking O
about O
the O

two S-CARDINAL
kids O

Audrey S-PERSON

Tel B-GPE

%mm O
%mm O
%mm O

So O
yeah O

's O
a O

But O
you O
're O
talking O
about O
jobs O
in O
good O
places O
, O
good O
solid O
companies O
developing O
companies O
who O
%um O

the O
thing O
just O
for O
the O
fun O
of O
it O
then O
%uh O

You O
know O
how O
I O
feel O
that O

yeah O

little O
Liz S-PERSON
has O
her O
own O
reasons O
for O
you O
know O
being O
in O
America S-GPE
. O

You O
should O
feel O
comfortable O
staying O
there O
, O

just O
for O
the O
fun O
%uh O
%ah O
send O
me O
%uh O
%ah O
a O
resume O

okay O
. O
I O
'll O
do O
that O
. O

And O
I O
'll O
just O
pass O
it O
on O
just O
to O
get O
an O
idea O
of O
how O
much O
you O
may O
be O
able O
to O
make O
. O

That O
sounds O
okay O

yeah O
. O

I O
think O
that O
's O
a O
excellent O
idea O
. O

%um O
, O
I O
know O
your O
wife O
does O
n't O
believe O
me O

but O
%uh O
we O
think O
about O
you O
guys O
like O
continuously O
. O

and O
it O
really O
%uh O
makes O
my O
heart O
ache O
. O

But O
%uh O




yeah O

until O
like O
you O
find O
something O
that O
is O
n't O
stressful O
and O
not O
boring O
. O

yeah O

that O
's O
the O
main O
two S-CARDINAL
combinations O
right O
? O

yeah O
. O

Not O
stressful O
and O
not O
boring O

yeah O
. O

Well O
it O
's O
like O
I O
have O
no O
problems O
with O
secretarial O
work O

okay O
that O
's O
what O
fitted O
in O
to O
that O
category O
because O
if O
you O
are O
a O
busy O
enough O
secretary O
you O
know O
%eh O
%mm O
. O
you O
do O
n't O
get O
bored O
because O
you O
are O
always O
doing O
something O
different O

and O
if O
your O
employer O
is O
a O
relatively O
decent O
human O
being O
you O
know O
two S-CARDINAL
if's O
there O

mhm O
. O

but O
you O
get O
no O
respect O

I O
mean O
oh O
you O
're O
a O
secretary O

and O
the O
pay O
is O
pretty O
crummy O

well O
it O
's O
pretty O
much O
the O
same O
as O
what O
I O
'm O
getting O
you O
know O
%um O
depending O
upon O
where O
you O
work O
and O
all O

but O
you O
know O
it O
's O
like O
that O
's O
no O
answer O
either O

so O
I O
've O
just O
been O
toying O
with O
this O
idea O
of O
going O
back O
to O
school O
and O
getting O
a O
computer O
science O
degree O
so O
I O
can O
always O
be O
gainfully O
employed O
. O

But O
anyway O
, O

and O
you O
can O
think O
about O
that O
pregnancy O
thing O

oh O
yeah O

that O
pregnancy O
thing O

yeah O

that O

do O
the O

Maybe O
there O
's O
your O
hormones O
calling O
. O

yeah O

well O
no O

the O
funny O
thing O
is O
it O
's O
like O
ten O
years O
ago O
I O
would O
've O
said O
oh O
yeah O
that O
was O
what O
I O
really O
wanted O
to O
be O
doing O
is O
having O
a O
baby O
you O
know O

but O
like O
at O
this O
point O
in O
time O
it O
's O
kind O
of O
like O
we O
're O
going O
to O
do O
it O
because O
if O
we O
do O
n't O
do O
it O
%uh O
%eh O
you O
know O
in B-DATE
the I-DATE
next I-DATE
year E-DATE
or O
two S-CARDINAL
we O
'd O
regret O
it O
you O
know O

we O
figure O
it O
's O
something O
we O
'd O
want O
to O
do O

it O
's O
not O
like O
we O
're O
doing O
it O
because O
we O
have O
to O
do O
it O
or O
there O
's O
peer O
pressure O

or O
well O
a O
%mm O
little O
peer O
pressure O

oh O
no O
no O
no O

I O
know O
exactly O
where O
you O
're O
at O
because O
I O
think O
about O
that O
too O

I O
got O
about O
like O
six S-CARDINAL
or O
seven B-DATE
years E-DATE

I O
figure O
my O
body O
is O
a O
very O
slow O
%um O
yeah O
**maturer** O

you O
know O
what O
I O
mean O

like O
I O
did O
n't O
get O
my O
period O
until O
I O
was O
sixteen S-DATE

I O
mean O
I O
look O
like O
about O
%uh O
%uh O
at O
least O
five S-CARDINAL
or O
six B-DATE
years E-DATE
younger O
than O
I O
actually O
am O

-- O
and O
I O
'm O
just O
starting O
to O
get O
my O
period O
actually O
now O
-- O
yeah O
yeah O
as O
an O
adult O
. O

So O
I O
kind O
of O
figure O
well O
I O
'm O
probably O
good O
until O
at O
least O
some O
time O
in O
the B-DATE
early I-DATE
forties E-DATE

and O
I O
could O
probably O
go O
a O
little O
longer O
than O
that O

I O
know O
there O
's O
a O
risk O
and O
all O
that O
bullshit O

yeah O
. O

but O
%um O
yeah O
I O
think O
about O
that O
too O
because O
it O
's O
like O
I O
mean O
I O
kind O
of O
like O
the O
way O
things O
are O
going O
in O
the O
total O
lack O
of O
responsibility O
. O

I O
know O

well O
I O
mean O
that O
's O
the O
thing O

kids O
are O
cute O
and O
all O
that O

and O
we O
%mm O
slept O
until O
noon S-TIME

we O
got O
up O
about B-TIME
ten E-TIME
and O
was O
like O
oh O
we O
have O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
played O
with O
the O
cats O
fell O
back O
to O
sleep O

okay O
I O
mean O
we O
're O
talking O
total O
slackers O

%mm O

and O
I O
thought O
gee O
you O
know O
if O
we O
had O
a O
kid O
we O
could O
n't O
do O
this O
you O
know O

and O

%mm O

No O

you O
got O
to O
be O
focused O
on O
that O

and O
I O
mean O
there O
's O
a O
lots O
of O
other O
things O
that O

I O
mean O
as O
far O
as O
like O
living O
situation O
I O
was O
feeling O
kind O
of O
settled O
you O
know O
like O
-- O
Right O
. O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
be O
like O
traipsing O
around O

but O
I O
mean O
I O
could O
say O
that O
for O
the O
next O
five S-CARDINAL
or O
even O
eight S-CARDINAL
or O
maybe O
-- O
yeah O
. O
-- O
ten B-DATE
years E-DATE
alright O

even O
if O
I O
could O
project O
that O
far O
which O
I O
really O
ca O
n't O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
got O
a O
kid O
you O
ca O
n't O
do O
fucking O
ten B-DATE
years E-DATE
w- O
-- O

I O
know O
. O

-- O
it O
's O
like O
cool O
I O
think O
I O
'll O
go O
off O
to O
the O
Orient S-LOC
and O
start O
like O
bouncing O
from O
country O
country O
. O

I O
know O

well O
and O
I O
mean O
okay O
Emory S-PERSON
wants O
to O
get O
his O
doctorate O

so O
we O
'll O
know O
next O
Spring O
if O
he O
can O
get O
at O
least O
accepted O
into O
the O
program O
which O
hopefully O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
you O
know O

and O
then O
there O
's O
four S-CARDINAL
or O
five B-DATE
years E-DATE
doing O
the O
damn O
work O

and O
%mm O
. O
He O
's O
crazy O

he O
wants O
it O

that O
's O
fine O

he O
can O
do O
it O

no O
problem O

but O
%um O
that O
sort O
of O
ties O
us O
up O
here O
although O
we O
like O
the O
place O

we O
're O
in O
no O
hurry O
to O
leave O
it O

yeah O
. O

and O
that O
would O
be O
good O

But O
then O
you O
know O
what O
if O
he O
could O
get O
a O
position O
overseas O
again O
which O
is O
something O
both O
of O
us O
have O
said O
would O
be O
pretty O
darn O
good O
because O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
%um O
you O
know O
after O
coming O
back O
from O
Spain O
from O
those B-DATE
two I-DATE
and I-DATE
half I-DATE
years E-DATE
it O
was O
n't O
so O
much O
an O
adjustment O
to O
the O
way O
things O
were O

it O
's O
just O
asking O
the O
question O
gee O
do O
we O
really O
like O
%um O
the O
way O
things O
are O
over O
here O
with O
the O
lifestyle O
the O
nine S-CARDINAL
to O
five S-CARDINAL
kind O
of O
thing O

I O
mean O
I O
'm O
really O
in O
the O
nine S-CARDINAL
to O
five S-CARDINAL
thing O
more O
so O
than O
he O
is O

you O
know O
he O
should O
be O
there O
by O
oh O
oh O
well O
let O
's O
say O
eight B-TIME
thirty E-TIME
to O
nine S-TIME

but O
yeah O

he O
does O
n't O
care O
when O

well O
okay O

%um O
and O
his O
professor O
is O
obviously O
%uh O
%uh O
a O
great O
person O
to O
work O
for O

so O
I O
'm O
envious O

but O
%um O
whatever O

you O
know O
I O
'm O
caught O
up O
%mm O
. O
-- O
in O
it O

and O
I O
do O
n't O
like O
it O
you O
know O

too O
many O
days O
I O
'm O
working O
and O
eating O
at O
my O
desk O
at O
about B-TIME
twelve I-TIME
o'clock E-TIME

and O
I O
'm O
thinking O
%mm O
. O
This O
is O
crazy O
you O
know O

in O
Spain S-GPE
%uh O
we O
had O
this O
break O

and O
you O
sat O

you O
talked O
to O
people O
you O
know O

you O
enjoyed O
your O
food O

you O
relaxed O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
you O
know O

and O
it O
's O
a O
fairly O
productive O
nation O
right O
you O
know O

What O
's O
going O
on O
here O
? O



yeah O

I O
mean O
they O
both O
have O
the O
advantages O
and O
disadvantages O

what O
you O
have O
to O
do O
is O
concentrate O
on O
the O
advantages O
in O
what O
ever O
place O
you O
're O
in O
-- O
mhm O
-- O
and O
think O
about O
the O
disadvantages O
of O
the O
place O
that O
you O
're O
not O
in O
. O

yeah O

Otherwise O
you O
go O
nuts O
right O
? O

That O
's O
true O
, O

yeah O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
know O
Laura S-PERSON
tried O
to O

%uh O
because O
we O
have O
email O
and O
so O
she O
sent O
me O
a O
letter O
back O
saying O
you O
know O
remember O
how O
crowded O
the O
transportation O
is O
and O
%uh O
what O
else O
-- O
%mm O
. O
how O
expensive O
everything O
is O

and O
%uh O
you O
know O
I O
remember O
those O
things O
of O
course O
you O
know O
-- O

And O
work O
you O
know O
possibilities O
were O
a O
lot O
more O
limited O

True O
. O

and O
the O
language O
you O
know O
yeah O
. O
constantly O
like O
kind O
of O

like O
I O
mean O
those O
could O
be O
considered O
positive O
things O
as O
well O

yeah O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
mind O
as O
well O
think O
of O
them O
in O
a O
negative O
vie- O
rather O
than O

mhm O
sure O

They O
just O
like O
worrying O
over O
them O
. O

Well O
you O
know O
and O
that O
's O
why O
it O
helps O
to O
have O
kind O
of O
a O
glimpse O
into O
the O
future O
right O
? O

And O
that O
's O
how O
we O
got O
to O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
Spain S-GPE
in O
the O
first S-ORDINAL
place O
is O
we O
said O
we O
wanted O
to O
live O
abroad O
and O
we O
would O
try O
to O
do O
it O
you O
know O
as O
teachers O

and O
it O
turned O
out O
that O
way O
because O
-- O
%mm O
. O
-- O
we O
had O
this O
idea O
of O

and O
I O
really O
feel O
that O
that O
's O
important O

and O
so O
what O
I O
'm O
having O
an O
idea O
of O
now O
is O

okay O
you O
know O
Emory S-PERSON
works O
on O
his O
doctorate O

it O
takes O
about O
five S-CARDINAL
or O
six B-DATE
years E-DATE

we O
have O
the O
kid O
probably O

he O
gets O
a O
research O
position O
somewhere O
in O
France S-GPE
or O
in O
Spain S-GPE
%um O

and O
then O
we O
move O
over O
there O

and O
you O
know O
I O
take O
care O
of O
the O
kid O
and O
do O
some O
you O
know O
little O
day O
labor O
whatever O
you O
know O

we O
'll O
see O

%mm O
. O

%um O
and O
we O
have O
relatively O
mellow O
life O
for O
who O
knows O
five S-CARDINAL
or O
ten B-DATE
years E-DATE

and O
then O
we O
take O
it O
from O
there O
. O

yeah O

because O
even O
like O
you O
know O
I O
mean O
all O
that O
stuff O
right O
is O
all O
so O
subject O
to O
whatever O
change O
in O
the O
weather O
that O
happens O
to O
be O
right O
? O

mhm O
. O

oh O
I O
know O

I O
know O

and O
it O
's O
like O
you O
know O
what O
I O
think O
because O
I O
get O
the O
same O
as O
you O

like O
some O
days O
it O
's O
just O
kind O
of O
like O
you O
know O
what O
the O
hell O
am O
I O
doing O
not O
with O
my O
life O
but O
ge- O

but O
I O
mean O
just O
like O
where O
do O
I O
get O
the O
animal O
just O
you O
know O
to O
do O
anything O
you O
know O

I O
just O
lay O
in O
bed O
and O
dream O
for O
the O
whole O
day O
easily O

yeah O

I O
know O
. O

Well O
I O
know O

I O
know O
what O
you O
're O
saying O

I O
feel O
there O
's O
sort O
of O
a O
line O
to O
cross O
too O
between O
really O
planning O
it O
out O
and O
worry O
and O
stressing O
over O
it O
because O
for O
a O
while O
a O
couple O
months O
back O
there O
I O
was O
thinking O
in O
terms O
of O
oh O
gosh O
you O
know O
can O
we O
ever O
afford O
a O
house O

%mm O
. O

and O
then O
we O
sat O
down O
and O
sort O
of O
looked O
at O
it O
financially O
and O
said O
is O
this O
what O
we O
really O
want O
to O
be O
worrying O
about O
right O
now O

and O
you O
know O
I O
realize O
no O

yeah O
absolutely O
. O

and O
so O
you O
know O
you O
can O
sort O
of O
focus O
too O
much O
on O
the O
future O

or O
I O
know O
I O
have O
this O
tendency O
to O
do O
that O
. O

And O
miss O
the O
present O
completely O

I O
mean O
miss O
like O
you O
know O
the O
smell O
of O
the O
goddamn O
onions O
frying O
in O
the O
pan O
yeah O
. O
yeah O
yeah O
. O
you O
know O
and O
each O
little O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
like O
as O
far O
as O
I O
'm O
concerned O
there O
's O
like O
no O
pleasure O
that O
's O
as O
intense O
as O
the O
one O
that O
you O
are O
experiencing O
at O
that O
moment O
you O
know O

you O
can O
think O
about O
what O
something O
might O
be O
like O
or O
reminisce O
about O
the O
past O

but O
like O
when O
you O
're O
there O
in O
that O
moment O
it O
's O

I O
mean O
everything O
else O
just O
kind O
of O
like O

it O
's O
almost O
like O
time O
does O
n't O
exist O
. O
yeah O
. O
You O
know O

yeah O

Well O
I O
know O
one O
of O
the O
best O
moments O
I O
can O
recall O
in O
these B-DATE
past I-DATE
two I-DATE
months E-DATE
is O

okay O
I O
get O
to O
work O
a O
little O
bit O
late O
which O
is O
common O

and O
they O
do O
n't O
really O
care O
since O
I O
'm O
an O
hourly O
you O
know O

you O
have O
to O
be O
within O
a O
certain O
time O
frame O

%mm O
. O

and O
so O
everyone O
else O
is O
parked O
. O

I O
'm O
way O
out O
there O
in O
the O
parking O
lot O
closer O
to O
where O
the O
trees O
are O

and O
you O
know O
I O
close O
the O
door O

I O
just O
take O
a O
deep O
breath O
as O
I O
go O
okay O
another O
day O

and O
I O
hear O
the O
birds O
singing O
-- O

yeah O
. O

and O
I O
just O
stop O
for O
a O
minute O
and O
listen O
to O
the O
birds O

and O
it O
sort O
of O
cheers O
me O
up O

you O
know O
I O
realize O
what O
a O
minute O
okay O

in O
that O
nasty O
sterile O
office O
where O
the O
windows O
do O
n't O
even O
open O

%eh O
%um O
I O
will O
be O
for O
the O
next B-TIME

but O
out O
here O
there O
still O
is O
some O
life O

and O
just O
sort O
of O
cheers O
me O
up O
to O
know O
that O

okay O

I O
can O
come O
back O
to O
it O

know O

So O
that O
's O

yeah O

in O
that O
moment O
I O
mean O
nobody O
is O
going O
to O
like O
interfere O
with O
that O
at O
all O

There O
you O
are O

save O

and O
you O

you O
might O
need O
a O
reservation O
too O

yeah O
%um O

yeah O

I O
will O

I O
should O
have O
some O
visitors O

and O
my O
family O
's O
planning O
on O
coming O
this O
summer O

so O
I O
'll O
take O
them O
there O
and O
this O
fondue O
place O
I O
wanted O
to O
take O
them O
to O
also O
. O

yeah O
yeah O

Is O
the O
one O
over O
in O
Gracia S-GPE
that O

it O
's O
kind O
of O
on O
a O
corner O
I O
think O

I O
think O
I O

%uh O

no O

there O
's O
a O
couple O
places O
in O
Gracia S-GPE
that O
I O
've O
been O
going O
to O

uh-huh O
. O

But O
%uh O
there O
's O
one O
in O
the O
%um O
Bario B-LOC
Gottigo E-LOC

actually O
it O
's O
on O
the O
other O
side O
of O
Leotana S-GPE
%huh O
. O
Like O
down O
over O
by O
the O
Bornillo O

okay O
. O

And O
I O
've O
only O
eaten O
there O
once O
alright O

but O
I O
've O
been O
in O
a O
million O
times O
because O
every O
time O
I O
pass O
with O
somebody O
I O
have O
to O
show O
them O
the O
place O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

Actually O
you O
know O
I O
know O
where O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O

I O
have O
a O
friend O
my O
friend O
from O
England S-GPE

I O
do O
n't O
remember O
if O
I O
told O
you O
about O
her O

she O

my O
old O
%um O
roommate O
mhm O
. O
From O
Oviato S-GPE

she O
got O
a O
job O
down O
here O

she O
's O
coming O
on O
Friday S-DATE
to O
live O

mhm O

And O
%ah O
I O

this O
is O
like O
the O
perfect O

because O
when O
we O
lived O
in O
Oviato S-GPE
we O
used O
to O
go O
to O
this O
fondue O
place O
all O
the O
time O

that O
would O
be O
the O
perfect O
place O
to O
take O
her O
when O
she O
gets O
her O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

well O
I O
'm O
glad O
to O
hear O
that O
you O
got O
a O
job O
that O
you O
like O
and O
%uh O
%um O
think O
that O
you O
were O
able O
to O
stay O

I O
was O
a O
little O
bit O
worried O
at O
first O
you O
know O
when O
you O
got O
back O
there O
because O
the O
money O
would O
run O
out O
probably O
in O
April S-DATE
or O
so O

and O
you O
know O

yeah O

And O
I O
mean O
I O
knew O
I O
would O
get O
a O
job O

and O
after O
I O
just O
stopped O
thinking O
about O
it O
I O
just O
thought O
well O
fuck O
it O

I O
am O
going O

it O
's O
like O
inevitable O

and O
I O
want O
something O

I O
have O
to O
get O
something O

and O
I O
will O

uh-huh O

%um O
%huh O

But O
I O
just O
thought O
that O
you O
know O
I O
'll O
get O
a O
job O

and O
at O
this O
point O
if O
I O
get O
desperate O
I O
'll O
just O
have O
to O
take O
anything O

yeah O
. O

And O
the O
fact O
that O
I O
like O
kind O
of O
fell O
into O
something O
that O
's O
Fairly O
sweet O

I O
mean O
%eh O
in O
the O
beginning O
everything O
kind O
of O
starts O
out O
nice O

but O
I O
'm O
changing O
my O
attitude O
to O
the O
point O
where O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
get O
stressed O
out O
about O
it O
too O
much O
. O

I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O
try O
to O
change O
anything O

Good O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O
in O
there O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
do O
a O
nice O
job O

I O
'm O
going O
to O
have O
a O
good O
time O
uh-huh O
. O
you O
know O

and O
I O
'm O
not O
going O
to O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
not O
the O
same O

I O
'm O
either O

like O
from O
working O
with O
kids O

I O
mean O
that O
was O
like O
you O
know O
my O
career O
for O
like B-DATE
eight I-DATE
years E-DATE

mhm O
. O

But O

you O
know O
more O
like O

it O
's O
nice O

it O
's O
really O
nice O

Well O
and O

back O
to O
that O
if O
you O
wanted O
to O
you O
know O
working O
at O

like O
I O
've O
always O
wanted O
to O

I O
do O
n't O

bad O
tha- O

they O

growth O
hormone O

yeah O

yeah O

I O

they O
do O
the O
chickens O

they O
want O
the O

yeah O

oh O
they O
do O
it O
here O
you O
know O

it O
's O
ap- O

I O
'm O
getting O
into O
a O
subject O
which O
I O
really O
did O
n't O
intend O

but O
in O
Canada S-GPE
they O
wo O
n't O
do O
it O

no O
no O

Well O
a O
lot O
of O
people O
do O
n't O
eat O
meat O
anymore O
because O
of O
you O
know O
all O
these O
objections O
and O
all O

they O
've O
stopped O
%uh O

it O
's O
true O

it O
's O
true O

it O

Israelis S-GPE
do O
n't O
eat O
that O
much O
meat O
anyway O

it O
's O
more O
we O
eat O
fruit O
vegetables O
an- O
yeah O
yeah O
stuff O

nobody O
really O
eats O
steaks O
anymore O

like O
I O
grew O
up O
on O
steaks O
all O
the O
time O
from O
Sam B-ORG
's I-ORG
Supermarket E-ORG
you O
know O
all O
the O

yeah O

from O
Sam O
's O
Supermark- O

uh-huh O

yeah O

jeez O
%uh O
the O
last O
time O
he O
had O
a O
steak O
was O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
months O
ago O

we O
do O
n't O
even O
eat O
steaks O
anymore O

but O
duh O
%eh O
in O
America S-GPE
too O
they O
do O
n't O
eat O
as O
much O
do O
they O

%uh O
no O

because O
for O
heart O
the O
fat O
is O
supposed O
by O
very O
bad O

yes O



Hello O

oh O
yeah O

yeah O

you O
said O
people O
are O
not O

no O

the O
red O
meat O
is O
suffering O
I O
guess O

I O
noticed O
that O
last O
time O
I O
was O
home O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
eat O
any O
either O

so O

yeah O

I O
know O
it O
's O
not O
a O
good O
idea O

I O

but O
Canada O
does O
n't O
use O
that O
junk O

I O
mean O
and O
they O
tell O
us O
I O
think O
Europe S-GPE
wo O
n't O
buy O
from O
us O
because O
they O
do O
n't O
want O
the O
hormones O
with O
stuff O
in O
it O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
know O

I O
know O

it O
's O
%uh O

but O
we O
're O
using O
it O
naturally O

Well O

so O
everything O
you O
kn- O

I O
tell O
you O
it O
breaks O
my O
heart O
when O
I O
see O
them O
following O
that O

they O
think O
everything O
is O
so O
wonderful O

if O
there O
's O
some O

yeah O

yeah O

I O
know O

they O
take O
the O
good O
and O
the O
bad O
all O
the O

and O
that O
's O
t- O

yeah O

oh O
it O
's O
pitiful O

that O
makes O
me O
very O
very O
sad O

you O
know O
oh O
it O
's O
%eh O

very O
sad O

and O
even O
the O
Russians S-NORP
they O
come O
over O

and O
I O
know O
I O
can O
see O
the O
attitude O
%ah O
well O
that O
of O
course O
they O
know O
for O
ins- O

he O
's O
working O
in O
a O
neighborhood O
association O
like O
on O
funds O

yeah O

yeah O

on O
grants O

he O
does O
a O
wonderful O
job O

and O
they O
help O
him O

oh O
I O
think O
he O
was O
n't O
working O
when O
Holly S-PERSON
was O
here O

I O
think O
he O
was O
n't O
working O

he O
was O
n't O
working O
over O
yeah O
oh O
that O
's O
good O
that O
he O
three B-DATE
and I-DATE
half I-DATE
years E-DATE

but O
this O
is O
parttime O

but O
it O
's O
very O
involving O

it O
's O
very O
exciting O

oh O
that O
's O
nice O

and O
I O
thought O
that O
the O
people O
line O
up O
to O
see O
him O

and O
it O
's O
about O
getting O
help O
with O
housing O
and O
food O
stamps O
and O
everything O

yeah O

and O
a O
lady O
said O
you O
know O
my O
husband O
died O
and O
old O
lady O

I O
said O
oh O
I O
'm O
sorry O

she O
says O
I O
really O
thought O
United B-GPE
States E-GPE
that O
you O
do O
n't O
die O
you O
know O

and O
I O
knew O
that O
underlying O
it O
they O
really O
believe O
that O
because O
if O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O

yeah O

they O
know O
everyone O
dies O

but O
underneath O
they O
feel O
maybe O
you O
do O
n't O
die O
until O
you O
're O
very O
very O
old O

but O
they O
do O
n't O
believe O
that O
so O
many O
people O
die O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States E-GPE
because O
it O
's O
so O
wonderful O

oh O
wow O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O
they O
got O
that O
idea O
from O

yeah O

but O
you O
see O
how O
it O
is O

jeez O

so O
everybody O
has O
these O
wrong O
conceptions O

I O
know O

I O
know O
%eh O

%eh O
%uh O
it O
's O
%uh O
pitiful O

but O

oh O
well O

yeah O

I O
'm O
su- O

Holly O

busy O
with O
all O
her O

right O

and O
you O

just O

so O

that O
's O
right O

and O
the O
teachers O
used O
to O
give O
us O
tests O
on O
those O
days O
just O
to O
be O
mean O

and O
we O
used O
to O
miss O
the O

everything O

and O

I O

Passover S-EVENT

used O
to O
be O
embarrassed O
bringing O
matzos O

everything O

and O
here O
I O
mean O
You O

they O
do O
n't O

any O
of O
those O
feelings O
at O
all O
you O
know O

I O
know O

I O
know O

I O
know O

it O
's O
th- O

it O
's O
very O
different O

so O



I O

Fred B-PERSON
Allen E-PERSON

but O
they O
're O
just O
names O
to O
me O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
them O

yeah O

oh O
because O
you O
were O
%ah O
you O
know O

yeah O

they O
had O
a O
farm O
when O
they O
were O
first O
married O
which O
was O
like O
nineteen B-DATE
forty I-DATE
eight E-DATE

yeah O
? O

and O
then O
they O
moved O
away O

hello O

%uh O
oh O

yeah O

I O
'm O

yeah O

So O
I O
think O
I O

five S-CARDINAL
or O
ten B-TIME
minutes E-TIME

as O
far O
as O
I O

hang O
up O

it O
's O
nice O
talking O
to O
you O

yeah O

yeah O

%um O

So O
what O
about O
the O
Allens S-PERSON
? O

then O
they O
moved O
away O
to O
Middletown S-GPE

he O
was O
in O
the O
girls O
' O

do O
you O
remember O
the O
girls O
' O
reformatory O
in O
Hudson S-GPE

yeah O

yeah O

%um O

It O
was O
right O
across O
the O
street O
from O
my O
Aunt O
Seal S-PERSON
's O
house O

oh O
she O
lived O
there O
? O

On O
Worth B-LOC
Avenue E-LOC
I O
th- O

She O
did O
on O
Wor- O

yeah O
like O
Bessie S-PERSON
lived O
on O
Worth B-LOC
Avenue E-LOC

yeah O

%um O

yeah O

%um O
well O
it O
was O
%um O
my O
Uncle O
Ralph S-PERSON
's O

it O
was O
my O
father O
's O
%eh O
you O
know O
half O
brother O

right O

right O

I O
remember O

yeah O

Mitnics O
the O
Mitnics O

yes O

yes O

Well O
what O
about O
the O
Allens S-PERSON

what O
was O
their O
connection O
to O
that O

Well O
so O
originally O
he O
had O
come O
back O
from O
the O
army O

they O
got O
married O

he O
graduated O
Cornell S-ORG
agricultural O

had O
to O
be O
a O
farmer O

so O
about O
maybe O
two S-CARDINAL
three B-DATE
years E-DATE
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
many O
years O
they O
had O
a O
dairy O
farm O

and O
you O
know O
how O
rough O

they O
were O
slaves O

they O
could O
n't O
go O
anywhere O
do O
anything O

yeah O

they O
had O
to O
stay O
on O
the O
farm O
because O
it O
's O
a O
small O
you O
know O

I O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
of O
this O

yeah O

but O
that O
's O
a O
lot O
like O
you O

you O
're O
much O
younger O
than O
me O

I O
was O
born O
in O
fifty S-CARDINAL

oh O
so O
you O
're O
much O

I O
'm O
born O
in O
nineteen B-DATE
thirty I-DATE
nine E-DATE

so O
you O
're O

in O
nineteen B-DATE
fifty E-DATE

yeah O

yeah O

there O
's O
a O
difference O

yeah O

Yes O

so O
they O
left O
maybe O
before O
you O
were O
born O

yes O

yeah O

could O
b- O

or O
just O
about O
the O
time O
you O
were O
born O
they O
left O
Hudson S-GPE

yeah O

not O
the- O

So O
then O
they O
went O
to O
Middletow- O

%um O
then O
he O
came O
%um O
for O
the O
girls O
' O
school O

he O
became O

since O
he O
did O
n't O
at O
farming O

could O
n't O
be O
managed O

yeah O

he O
became O

he O
had O
been O
a O
captain O
in O
the O
army O
over O
difficult O
troops O
yeah O
So O
that O
he O
got O
into O
the O
correctional O
facility O
business O

I O
mean O
he O
got O
a O
job O

the O
girls O
' O
training O
school O
there O
needed O
someone O

and O
he O
got O
into O
that O

And O
he O
remained O
the O
rest O
of O
his O
life O

oh O

so O
after O
that O
they O
moved O
to O
Middletown S-GPE

and O
then O
they O
went O
to O
South B-GPE
Portright E-GPE
upstate O
near O
Onianta S-GPE

yeah O
yeah O
and O
how O
shall O
I O
say O
he O
rebuilt O
a O
boys O
' O
training O
school O

and O
it O
was O
so O
successful O
they O
named O
it O
after O
him O
now O

oh O
I O
did O
n't O
know O
any O
of O
this O

yeah O

the O
Fred S-PERSON
All- O

yeah O

he O
's O
very O
very O
%um O
prominent O
in O
that O
field O
in O
the O
correc- O

no O
no O

he O
did O
a O
wonderful O
job O

in O
fact O
he O
had O
the O
best O
average O
of O
rehabilitation O
in O
the O
country O
for O
that O
age O
oh O
is O
that O
nice O
which O
is O
not O
too O
great O

but O
he O
had O
the O
best O
average O
in O
the O
country O

yeah O

what O
's O
he O
doing O
now O

yeah O

they O
're O
a O
wonderful O
couple O

Irene S-PERSON
died O

that O
's O
Bessie S-PERSON
's O

yeah O



%uh O
do O
you O

Lenny B-PERSON
Kocherstein E-PERSON
and O

of O
course O

Lenny S-PERSON
I O

%uh O
older O

her O
fi- O

she O

years E-DATE
older O

I O
just O

Lenny S-PERSON

Gloria S-PERSON

no O
I O
do O
n't O

Hudson S-GPE

. O

theoretically O
? O

yeah O
. O

You O
mean O
, O
do O
n't O
you O
well O
, O
you O
carry O
multiple O
calendars O
, O
so O
you O
never O
know O
? O

Well O
I O
do O
have O
two S-CARDINAL
. O

One S-CARDINAL
in O
the O
office O
and O
one S-CARDINAL
at O
home O
. O

oh O

The B-DATE
weekend I-DATE
after I-DATE
that E-DATE
%uh O
I O
will O
not O
be O
in O
town O
. O

But O
, O
%um O
yeah O
, O

as O
I O
say O
, O
theoretically O
I O
'm O
here O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
have O
n't O
decided O
whether O
I O
'm O
doing O
this O
yet O
. O

It O
is O
a O
bit O
silly O
, O
you O
know O
? O

I O
was O
just O
there O
. O

But O
I O
've O
been O
, O
%um O
, O

the O
next O
weekend O
again O
I O
'm O
invited O
for O
the O

let O
's O
see O

the O
child O
of O
my O
favorite O
cousin O
is O
being O
baptized O
, O

and O
they O
want O
me O
to O
be O
the O
godmother O

%mm O
. O

English S-LANGUAGE
. O

Patentante O
, O
ja O
. O

Yes O
, O

And O
, O
so O
, O
since O
I O
did O
n't O
go O
to O
their O
wedding O
, O
I O
-- O
feeling O
this O
big O
pressure O
. O

I O
should O
have O
just O
gone O
to O
the O
wedding O
last B-DATE
year E-DATE
. O

It O
was O
, O
like O
oh O
yeah O
. O
in O

They O
started O
asking O
me O
when O
I O
was O
on O
vacation O
already O
. O

And O
so O
I O
'm O
sort O
of O

it O
's O
easier O
to O
think O
about O
doing O
it O
when O
you O
're O
on O
vacation O
yeah O
. O
than O
if O
you O
get O
this O
idea O
%eh O
when O
you O
're O
at O
work O
and O
say O
, O
oh O
I O
ca O
n't O
go O
in O
four B-DATE
weeks E-DATE
. O

How O
could O
I O
possibly O
just O
do O
that O
? O

yeah O
I O
know O
the O
feeling O
. O

I O
m- O

But O
once O
you O
're O
in O
vacation O
mode O
, O
it O
's O
sort O
of O
like O
well O
why O
should O
n't O
I O
? O

I O
have O
the O
vacation O
, O

it O
's O
just O
you O
know O
, O
the O
time O
, O
and O
the O
money O
, O

and O
what O
is O
money O
for O

yeah O
. O

Right O
. O

So O
I O
have O
to O
make O
up O

It O
's O
a O
debate O
. O

You O
sound O
like O
you O
're O
the O
bank O
. O

No O
. O

But O
I O
have O
to O
make O
up O
my O
mind O
here O
by O
Friday S-DATE
because O
that O
's O
when O
I O
can O
hold O
my O
ticket O
too O
. O

So O
I O
thought O
I O
could O
get O
a O
ticket O
. O

I O
just O
have O
to O
have O
a O
discussion O
with O
my O
boss O
. O

So O
you O
have O
to O
let O
me O
know O
what O
this O
entails O
as O
consequences O
for O
me O
? O

oh O
for O
, O

oh O
yes O
. O

oh O
there O
are O
good O
consequences O
, O
if O
you O
're O
willing O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
aside O
from O

so O
I O
have O
to O
be O
there O
on O
the B-DATE
twentieth E-DATE
in O
Berlin S-GPE
, O

okay O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

And O
I O
could O
n't O
go O
for O
you O
know O
, O
just O
, O
For O
the B-DATE
day E-DATE
. O
you O
know O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
. O

So O
I O
had O
to O
go O
at B-DATE
least I-DATE
a I-DATE
week E-DATE
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
there O
was O
an O
advantage O
. O

It O
's O
because O
, O

and O
if O
you O
'd O
like O
to O
join O
me O
I O
'd O
love O
it O
, O

I O
was O
also O
invited O
to O
a O
wedding O
on O
the B-DATE
twelfth E-DATE
somewhere O
near O
Duesseldorf S-GPE
. O

Between O
Duesseldorf S-GPE
and O
Essen S-GPE
. O

Well O
that O
can O
only O
be O
Rathingen S-GPE
or O

No O
it O
's O
north O
of O
Rathingen S-GPE
, O

because O
I O
've O
seen O
a O
map O
. O

But O
it O
's O
in O
a O
small O
thing O
. O

oh O
Ketting S-GPE
? O

Ketwig S-GPE
. O

Ketwig S-GPE
, O
Ketwig S-GPE
. O

that O
's O
almost O
Duesseldorf S-GPE
. O

%uh O
, O
that O
's O
almost O
Essen S-GPE
. O

okay O
. O

Whichever O
. O

I O
suppose O
that O
's O
close O
. O



yeah O
, O

it O
's O
not O
far O
. O

Through O
the B-FAC
S I-FAC
- I-FAC
bahn E-FAC
here O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
like B-TIME
twenty I-TIME
minutes E-TIME
. O

Or O
something O
. O

And O
so O
, O
if O
I O
do O
it O
, O
I O
'd O
love O
to O
have O
you O
join O
me O
. O

It O
's O
a O
fancy O
wedding O
too O
. O

Does O
that O
mean O
I O
have O
to O
get O

Do O
I O
have O
to O
wear O
a O
tie O
? O

Yes O
. O

Sure O
. O

y- O

%um O

could O
be O
it O
's O
actually O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
this O
. O

This O
is O
a O
German S-NORP
friend O
that O
I O

he O
worked O
here O
at O
NASA S-ORG
for O
like B-DATE
two I-DATE
years E-DATE
and O
was O
in O
mhm O
our O
German S-LANGUAGE
conversation O
club O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
he O
's O
marrying O
a O
German S-NORP
woman O
. O

I O
mean O
he O
just O
went O
back O
a O
little O
while O
ago O
because O
his O

No O
he O
's O
an O
American S-NORP
, O

but O
he O
's O
marrying O
a O
German S-NORP
woman O
. O

oh O
, O
he O
's O
a O
German S-NORP
. O

He O
's O
German S-NORP
too O
. O

yeah O
. O

They O
're O
both O
German S-NORP
. O

So O
this O
is O
a O
real O
mhm O
. O
German S-NORP
wedding O
. O

But O

And O
so O
he O
was O
saying O
we O
should O
come O
from O
our O

and O
one S-CARDINAL
other O
person O
from O
our O
group O
is O
going O
because O
we O
would O

he O
had O
n't O
gotten O
around O
to O
planning O
his O
vacation O
. O

So O
he O
's O
going O
to O
be O
there O
. O

So O
I O
thought O
well O
that O
's O
on O
the B-DATE
twelfth E-DATE
, O
and O
the O
other O
thing O
is O
on O
the B-DATE
twentieth E-DATE
, O
you O
know O
. O

Why O
not O
? O

And O
then O
in O
between O
I O
'm O
going O
to O
go O
down O
and O
586.14_588.20_A: O
see O
my O
relatives O
in O
Bonn S-GPE
. O

oh O
well O
the B-DATE
twentieth E-DATE
i- O
, O

I O
mean O
that O
could O
be O
a O
pro- O
, O
e- O

Well O
no O
not O
the O
twentieth S-DATE
. O

The B-DATE
twentieth E-DATE
is O
my O
baptism O
. O

%ah O
so O
. O

The O
wedding O
is O
the B-DATE
twelfth E-DATE
. O

The O
wedding O
is O
the B-DATE
twelfth E-DATE
? O

But O
it O
's O
like O
a O
real O
thing O
. O

There O
's O
like O
a O
wedding O
at O
eleven S-TIME
, O
and O
a O
lunch O
at O
Schloss B-FAC
Ketwig E-FAC
or O
something O
at O
lunchtime S-TIME
. O

And O
then O
at O
seven B-TIME
o'clock E-TIME
there O
is O
, O
let O
's O
see O
, O
%uh O
dinner O
dance O
. O
mit O
Abendgarderobe O
. O

oh O
God O
. O
nay O

But O
I O
thought O
you O
playing O
piano O
you O
must O
have O
that O
. O

Abendgarderobe O
. O

Does O
n't O
that O
mean O
like O
really O
fancy O
clothes O
? O

%uh O
, O
well O
. O

Ja O
, O
ja O
. O

Ball O
dresses O
and O
, O
you O
know O
, O
tuxedos O
and O
things O
. O

yeah O
, O
I O
know O
. O

I O
could O
n't O
believe O
it O

because O
I O
met O
, O

when O
I O
was O
there O
on O
the O
other O
trip O
, O
I O
had O
n't O
read O
the O
invitation O
before O
. O

I O
did O
n't O
think O
I O
was O
going O
. O

And O
so O
I O
had O
met O
, O
%uh O
, O
his O
name O
is O
Heiko S-PERSON
, O
for O
one O
day O
in O
Hamburg S-GPE
. O

We O
met O
. O

yeah O
. O

So O
he O
mentioned O
that O
he O
was O
looking O
for O
his O
tuxedo O
. O

And O
I O
said O
you O
're O
going O
to O
get O
married O
in O
a O
tuxedo O
? O

He O
said O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
. O

That O
evening O
. O

I O
've O
never O
heard O
of O
such O
a O
thing O
. O

Quite O
a O
wedding O
. O

But O
so O
if O
you O
want O
to O
bow O
out O
. O

Pardon O
? O

I O
said O
if O
you O
really O
do O
n't O
like O
those O
things O
. O

Well O
. O

But O
you O
know O
. O
It O
's O
great O
meals O
. O

Really O
. O

Free O
food O
. O

Aside O
from O
, O
we O
can O
talk O
, O

and O
they O
should O
be O
nice O
people O
. O

It O
'll O
be O

and O
then O
I O
'll O
know O
one S-CARDINAL
more O
person O
there O
. O

How O
old O
are O
they O
? O

oh O
. O

A O
little O
bit O
younger O
than O
us O
. O

oh O
, O
he O
's O
probably O

good O
question O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

Maybe O
he O
's O
thirty B-DATE
- I-DATE
two E-DATE
? O

That O
's O
okay O
. O

As O
long O
as O
they O
're O
not O
twenty B-DATE
- I-DATE
one E-DATE
. O

oh O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
, O
no O
. O

No O
%uh O
, O
spring O
chicken O

This O
is O
Herr O
Doktor O
Heiko B-PERSON
Hecht E-PERSON
and O
Jessika S-PERSON
whatever O
her O
name O
is O
. O

ooh O
. O

They O
actually O
met O
in O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
States E-GPE
. O
At O
I O
think O
the B-ORG
University I-ORG
&of I-ORG
Virginia E-ORG
, O
where O
he O
got O
his O
doctorate O
? O

Or O
, O
maybe O
it O
's O
not O
Virginia S-GPE
, O

but O
it O
's O
somewhere O
over O
there O
. O

mhm O
. O

Something O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

mhm O
%hm O
. O

yeah O
, O

so O
, O
you O
know O
, O
they O
're O
not O
really O
young O
. O

So O
I O
s- O
, O

their O
friends O
I O
presume O
are O
in O
the O
same O
age O
. O

I O
think O
there O
'll O
be O
a O
lot O
of O
family O
friends O
. O

I O
have O
a O
f- O

okay O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
'm O
sure O
. O

weddings O
are O
always O
family O
. O

and O
the O
way O
he O
was O
talking O
, O
it O
sounds O
like O
his O
wife O
's O
family O
is O
well O
- O
to O
- O
do O
or O
something O
. O

so O

yeah O

well O
if O
it O
, O
ye- O

Interesting O
people O
. O

If O
they O
're O
having O
a O
wedding O
with O
Abendgarderobe O
then O
it O
's O
going O
to O
be O
pretty O

that O
's O
what O
I O
thought O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O
what O
I O
thought O
. O

Up O
upscale O
. O

And O
that O
. O

So O
think O
about O
it O
. O

yeah O
. O
I O
'll O
let O
you O
think O
about O
that O
, O

and O
you O
can O
write O
me O
a O
note O
or O
give O
me O
a O
call O
. O

Because O
I O
know O
some O
people O
really O
hate O
weddings O
. O

But O
you O
're O
afraid O
to O
say O
no O
, O

or O
you O
have O
to O
think O
about O
it O
. O

But O
it O
's O
the B-DATE
twelfth E-DATE
. O

And O
otherwise O
, O
what O
I O
'd O
like O
to O
try O
to O
do O
is O
stay O
with O
you O
the O
twelfth S-DATE

Monday S-DATE
-- O
down O
to O
Bonn S-GPE
, O
or O
wherever O

years E-DATE
, O

so O
he O
'll O
be O
in O
Bad B-GPE
Munstereifel E-GPE
. O

mhm O

They O
've O
actually O
moved O
. O

They O
do O
n't O
live O
in O
Bonn S-GPE
now O
. O

They O
live O
in O
-- O
%um O
, O
Bad B-GPE
Neuena E-GPE
. O
Which O
is O
I O
guess O

Bad B-GPE
Neuena E-GPE
ja O
. O

yeah O
, O

just O
a O
little O
bit O
down O
. O

But O
I O
think O
they O
'll O
be O
in O
Munstereifel S-GPE
. O

And O
then O
my O
cousin O
, O
she O
still O
does O
live O
in O
Bonn S-GPE

so O
I O
'll O
get O
to O
see O
her O
. O

And O
then O
I O
'll O
zip O
off O
to O
Berlin S-GPE
Right O
. O
mhm O
mhm O
go O
to O
this O
wedding O
and O
see O
my O
favorite O
cousin O
. O

Do O
n't O
tell O
the O
other O
cousins O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

yeah O
. O

Because O
you O
see O
, O
when O
I O
was O
there O
before O
I O
could O
n't O
visit O
you O
because O
I O
did O
n't O
want O
to O
spend O
time O
visiting O
these O
other O
relatives O
in O
Bonn S-GPE
. O

you O
're O
so O
diplomatic O
about O
all O
of O
that O
, O
you O
know O

Well O
I O
mean O
if O
I O
was O
visiting O
you O
, O
it O
would O
be O
very O
hard O
not O
to O
visit O
them O
. O

but O
n- O

But O
the O
year O
before O
I O
. O

I O
would O
n't O
, O
%uh O
, O
tell O
on O
you O
, O
you O
know O
. O

I O
know O
you O
would O
n't O
tell O
. O

But O
the O
year O
before O
I O
did O
it O
. O

But O
that O
's O
because O
of O
we O
just O
stopped O
on O
the O
train O
and O
I O
had O
, O
you O
know O
, O
two B-TIME
hours E-TIME
. O

And O
we O
had O
our O
wild O
lunch O
. O

yeah O
. O

And O
on O
again O
. O

yeah O
. O

That O
's O

We O
, O
%uh O
, O
commiserated O
. O

Yes O
. O

That O
sounds O
like O
you O
have O
you O
know O
its O
positive O
end O
result O
, O
which O
is O
good O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
. O

I O
mean O
, O
it O
's O
a O
change O
, O

that O
's O
for O
sure O
. O

It O
's O
a O
change O
. O

And O
it O
is O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
, O
obviously O
. O

yeah O
, O

I O
, O

%eh O
but O
you O
know O
I O
really O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
it O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
work O
. O

I O
always O
have O
this O
feeling O
I O
'm O
just O
so O
terribly O
slow O
. O

I O
have O
this O
feeling O
I O
should O
always O
be O
doing O
these O
things O
much O
faster O
than O
I O
get O
them O
done O
. O

Well O
, O
so O
what O
if O
you O
're O
slow O
? O

You O
know O
, O
look O
at O
it O
the O
other O
way O
. O

yeah O

but O
I O
always O
keep O
%eh O
that O
I O
'm O
spending O
too O
much O
time O
, O
that O
I O
should O
be O
doing O
other O
things O
. O

yeah O
. O

I O
just O
had O
this O
talk O
about O
somebody O
who O
was O
you O
know O
, O
confirming O
, O
you O
know O

and O
I O
know O
I O
'm O
too O
self O
critical O
. O

So O
. O
It O
's O
not O
a O
good O
idea O
. O

Because O
I O
was O
complaining O
to O
them O
about O
my O
mother O

and O
they O
are O
this O
theory O
that O
, O
you O
know O
, O
what O
people O
do O
is O
a O
reflection O
of O
you O
. O

%huh O
. O

Because O
this O
woman O
had O
such O
a O
that O
people O
react O
to O
you O
as O
a O
reflection O
of O
you O
. O

And O
what O
I O
had O
mentioned O
about O
my O
mother O
bugging O
me O
was O
the O
fact O
that O
every O
time O
I O
see O
her O
or O
we O
even O
talk O
, O
she O
has O
to O
comment O
about O
my O
clothes O
, O
or O
what O
I O
'm O
wearing O
. O

and O
I O
was O
talking O
to O
this O
woman O
because O
she O
seemed O
to O
have O
such O
a O
good O
relationship O
with O
her O
mother O
. O

Like O
her O
mother O
treated O
her O
like O
a O
human O
being O
and O
not O
a O
kid O
. O

%hm O
yeah O

and O
so O
she O
said O
you O
know O
and O
she O
's O
just O
a O
reflection O
. O

You O
know O
your O
mother O
's O
being O
critical O
you O
know O
. O

Be O
you O
see O
that O
because O
you O
're O
critical O
to O
yourself O
too O
much O

Or O
you O
're O
filtering O
the O
information O
you O
get O
from O
your O
mother O

yeah O

but O
this O
is O
ridiculous O
. O

I O
mean O
%uh O
she O
's O
never O
let O
up O
on O
that O
. O

I O
mean O
it O
's O
crazy O
. O
You O
know O
. O

I O
do O
n't O
I O
mean O

and O
I O
think O
no O
not O
the O
last O
time O
the O
last O
time O
on O
the O
phone O
I O
bugged O
her O
about O
something O
else O
that O
I O
been O
trying O
to O
not O
take O
anymore O

but O
then O
she O
cries O

but O
that O
does O
n't O
work O
with O
me O
. O

uh-huh O
. O

That O
's O
good O
. O

Then O
she O
says O
I O
'm O
being O
mean O
. O

and O
I O
ignore O
the O
fact O
that O
she O
's O
crying O
. O

I O
'm O
pretty O
tough O
. O

yeah O

yeah O

speaking O
of O
crying O
, O
I O
have O
a O
colleague O
. O
An O
American S-NORP
girl O
, O
a O
dancer O
. O
mhm O
at O
a O
school O
in O
Cologne S-GPE
mhm O
Who O
somehow O
or O
other O
has O
fallen O
in O
love O
with O
me O
. O

mhm O

and O
now O
that O
I O
'm O
, O
going O
back O
to O
Duesseldorf S-GPE
she O
's O
all O
going O
crazy O
. O
%um O
and O
thinks O
%eh O

she O
's O
%eh O
concluded O
that O
I O
'm O
abandoning O
her O
. O

oho O

But O
it O
is O

Being O
stalked O
here O
? O

Pardon O
? O

In O
America S-GPE
, O
we O
would O
say O
are O
you O
being O
stalked O
? O




so O
he O
said O
to O
let O
your O
wife O
do O
it O
you O
know O

%uh O
right O

he O
says O
%uh O
you O
know O
no O
I O
'm O
going O
to O

%eh O
so O
now O
I O
'm O
at O
a O
point O
that O
it O
's O
very O
strange O

like O
I O
wo O
n't O
complain O
about O
anything O

or O
I O
ca O
n't O
complain O
about O
anything O

and O
I O
ca O
n't O
ask O
him O
to O
come O
help O
me O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
the O
night O
when O
I O
forgot O
to O
take O
out O
something O
they O
put O
in O
the O
freezer O

So O
we O
'll O
see O
how O
it O
goes O

hopefully O

I O
mean O
they O
promise O
me O
you O
know O
everybody O
that O
they O
're O
going O
to O
help O
me O
and O
that O
whatever O
I O
say O

But O
you O
know O
everybody O
gives O
you O
%uh O
these O
%uh O
pro- O

yeah O

so O
you O
've O
already O
started O

Well O
I O
've O
started O
working O
with O
Du O

like O
I O
do O
n't O
cook O
anymore O

I O
have O
n't O
worked O
in O
the O
kitchen O
for O
a O
week O
already O

I O
've O
been O
just O
doing O
with O
him O
learning O
how O
to O
do O
the O
orders O
and O
meeting O
all O
the O
%um O
sales O
people O

and O
%um O
I O
've O
learned O
how O
to O
work O
the O
computer O
which O
is O
the O
bigges- O

I O
said O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
how O
to O
turn O
it O
on O
even O

really O

So O
I O
'm O
not O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
if O
I O
could O
do O
it O
yet O
by O
myself O

but O
he O
's O
showing O
me O
teaching O
me O

and O
I O
think O
like O
the O
middle O
of O
this O
week O
he O
'll O
be O
there O
a B-DATE
few I-DATE
days E-DATE
with O
me O

and O
then O
anoth- O

he O
%um O

Maybe O
here O
and O
there O

but O
he O
's O
really O
basically O

What O
is O
he O
going O
to O
do O

He O
's O
going O
to O
be O
a O
teacher O
for O
%um O
High O
school O
computers O

oh O
okay O

yeah O

so O
he O
's O
only O
teaching O
three B-DATE
days E-DATE
a O
week O

so O
he O
always O
says O
that O
on O
the O
other O
days O
if O
I O
need O
him O
he O
'll O
come O
in O

the O
truth O
is O
he O
's O
been O
teaching O
and O
very O
patient O
and O
very O
good O

and O
he O
also O
is O
great O
that O
he O
has O
written O
down O
everything O

I O
'm O
sure O
he O
's O
thrilled O
to O
get O
out O
of O
there O

Well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O
%uh O

I O
mean O
now O
that O
I O
worked O
with O
him O
one O
to O
one O
He O
does O
do O
everything O
with O
his O
heart O

I O
mean O
he O
has O
a O
different O
head O
than O
everybody O
else O

like O
I O
know O
that O
he O
wants O
everything O
to O
be O
nice O
and O
to O
be O
good O
and O

but O
he O
's O
very O
separate O

and O
he O
does O
n't O
like O
to O
listen O
to O
other O
people O
's O
%um O
ideas O

but O
%um O
I O
'm O
sure O
financially O
he O
was O
probably O
great O
for O
the O
kibbutz O
because O
he O
was O
cheap O

yeah O

because O
he O
's O
also O

I O
'll O
tell O
you O

I O
worked O
with O
him O
this O
whole O
week O

he O
does O
n't O
eat O
a O
thing O
ever O

like O
all O
morning O
long O

so O
he O
does O
n't O
eat O

he O
does O
n't O
drink O
coffee O

I O
did O
n't O
see O
him O
drink O
anything O
water O
or O
anything O
else O

one O
day O
he O
said O
I O
better O
drink O
something O
I O
have O
a O
headache O
because O
it O
was O
really O
hot O

but O
I O
mean O
you O
know O
he O
does O
n't O
eat O
anything O

and O
then O
for O
lunch O
when O
we O
finally O
went O
to O
go O
get O
something O
to O
eat O
Also O
he O
eats O
like O
a O
little O
What O
we O
would O
eat O
maybe O
half O
for O
a O
meal O

and O
that O
's O
it O

so O
I O
can O
understand O
now O
why O
he O
thinks O
that O
because O
he O
does O
n't O
have O
big O
eyes O
you O
know O

right O

that O
's O
so O
funny O

but O
anyway O

no O

so O
he O
had O
agreed O
to O
do O
it O
for O
a B-DATE
year E-DATE

and O
his O
year O
is O
over O

I O

are O
you O
excited O
at O
all O
about O
it O

or O

well O
I O
'll O
tell O
you O
the O
truth O

until O
I O
made O
the O
decision O
I O
was O
scared O
and O
also O
utz O

I O
miss O
the O
cooking O
part O

You O
miss O
it O

that O
's O
funny O

I O

yeah O

yeah O

like O
this O
week O
even O
when O
they O
made O
the O
%um O
coleslaw O
you O
know O
& O
kept O
calling O
me O
to O
taste O
it O
and O
make O
sure O
that O
it O
was O
the O
way O
that O
I O
do O
it O

and O
so O
Matty S-PERSON
said O
to O
me O
Ellen S-PERSON
you O
did O
n't O
make O
the O
coleslaw O

I O
said O
it O
's O
over O
you O
know O

I O
ca O
n't O
do O
everything O

tha- O

and O
they O
're O
going O
to O
notice O
that O
the O
cooking O
is O
different O

Well O
that O
's O
what O
even O
**ruthie** O
says O
you O
know O

everyone O
thinks O
that O
the O
economie O
is O
so O
important O

but O
there O
's O
a O
lot O
of O
things O
that O
are O
very O
important O
of O
running O
the O
kitchen O

and O
we O
'll O
see O

%uh O
right O
now O
Ramon S-PERSON
%uh O



you O
know O
Cocoa S-PERSON
she O
got O
married O

She O
married O
that O
guy O

not O
the O
Israeli S-NORP
guy O
not O
the O
Sephardic S-NORP
guy O
but O
No O
you O
're O
kidding O
that O
little O
feminine O
kind O
of O
guy O

No O

but O
reme- O

when O
I O
was O
there O
in O
October S-DATE
she O
had O
that O
guy O
from O
Yerushalaim S-GPE
that O
guy O

yeah O

820.26_822.65_B: O
no O

but O
%um O
it O
was O
over O
already O
around O
then O

but O
they O
were O
still O
friends O

and O
this O
guy O
was O
a O
here O
or O
something O
drawer O

I O
think O
his O
family O
is O
Romanian S-NORP
or O
something O

anyway O

yeah O

it O
was O
very O
fast O

and O
they O
got O
married O

How O
old O
is O
she O
? O

She O
's O
eighteen B-DATE
and I-DATE
a I-DATE
half E-DATE

she O
'll O
be O
nineteen S-DATE
in O
December S-DATE

oh O
my O
god O

why O
did O
they O
allow O
that O

Well O
I O
guess O
they O
did O
n't O
have O
a O
choice O

but O
the O
worst O
thing O
was O
originally O
when O
she O
came O
to O
her O
parents O
and O
she O
was O
going O
to O
get O
married O
she O
was O
going O
to O
get O
married O
in O
October S-DATE

but O
she O
got O
engaged O
like O
before O
Pesach S-EVENT

so O
going O
to O
get O
married O
in O
October S-DATE

so O
they O
were O
n't O
so O
thrilled O

but O
at O
least O
okay O
it O
's O
%uh O

and O
then O
all O
of O
a O
sudden O
they O
came O
back O
and O
said O
no O
we O
want O
to O
get O
married O

they O
got O
married O
the O
I O
think O
oh O
my O
g- O
second B-DATE
week I-DATE
in I-DATE
June E-DATE

on O
kibbutz O

yeah O

it O
was O
beautiful O

we O
do O
weddings O
%eh O
so O
much O
nicer O
than O
in O
the O
old O
days O

first O
of O
all O
we O
rent O
tables O
and O
chairs O

yeah O

so O
it O
's O
like O

and O
we O
did O
it O
on O
the O
grass O
outside O
the O

and O
it O
was O
beautiful O

we O
read O

that O

so O
she O
's O
like O
the O
first O
child O
who O
got O
married O

right O

and O
we O
rented O
beautiful O
china O
and O
silverware O
and O
glasses O

wow O

beautiful O

I O
must O
admit O
it O
was O
really O
really O
beautiful O

and O
then O
serving O
everything O
we O
use O
like O
%um O
all O
different O
kinds O
of O
bought O
kind O
of O
%um O
paper O
plates O
that O

uh-huh O

probably O
like O
the O
hard O
plastic O

and O
it O
was O
amazing O
because O
they O
even O
had O
like O
a O
bar O
set O
up O

and O
they O
had O
oh O
my O
go- O
fruit O

they O
had O
hay O

and O
then O
they O
had O
fruit O

it O
was O
gorgeous O

it O
was O
absolutely O
gorgeous O

Does O
she O
now O
have O
to O
do O
tzavah O
or O
no O

no O
no O

but O
%ah O
marriage O
is O

you O
do O
n't O
have O
to O
do O
the O
tzavah O

oh O
my O
go- O

So O

's O
working O
now O
in O
the O

her O

Even O

the O
typical O
Ariella S-PERSON
story O

they O
came O
for O
Pesach S-EVENT

and O
then O
they O
told O

they O
waited O
to O
tell O

that O
they O
got O
engaged O

and O
the O
wedding O

and O
they O
were O
so O
angry O
because O
how O
the O
hell O
could O
they O
come O
back O
after O
years O

that O
's O
true O

No O

so O
on O
one O
hand O
I O
understand O
them O

it O
's O
not O
fair O

No O
of O
course O
not O

965.04_967.89_B: O
even O
they O
could O
have O
called O
them O
before O
Pesach S-EVENT

maybe O
they O
would O
've O
changed O
their O
minds O

but O

wait O

yeah O

Natan S-PERSON
's O
sister O
was O
here O
also O

So O
they O
were O
all O
upset O
that O
the O
grandparents O
did O
n't O
come O
back O
for O
the O
wedding O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O

you O
have O
to O
look O
at O
you O
know O
both O



oh O
my O

I O
ca O
n't O
believe O
she O
got O
married O

I O

she O
got O
married O

and O
then O
the O
week O
after O
Ta'al B-PERSON
Paer E-PERSON
got O
married O

you O
know O
Ta'al S-PERSON
is O
the O
oldest O
%uh O
girl O
on O
the O

I O

yeah O

where O
is O
she O
living O

Well O
her O
husband O
he O
looks O
like O
Mickey S-PERSON
our O
Mickey S-PERSON
yeah O
when O
Mickey S-PERSON
was O
really O
young O

so O
he O
looks O
really O
young O

%uh O
she O
just O
finished O
now O
the O
army O

and O
she O
met O
him O
during O
the O
army O

he O
's O
from O
a O
nonreligious O
kibbutz O

oh O
my O
gosh O

yeah O

So O
now O
they O
're O
living O
on O
his O
kibbutz O
%um O
because O
they O
allow O
like O
B'nai S-NORP
to O
live O
there O

but O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
they O
can O
work O
outside O
yeah O
do O
whatever O
they O
want O
until O
they O
decide O
what O
they O
want O
or O
do O
what O
they O
want O

do O
whatever O
they O
want O

study O

I O
do O
n't O
know O
what O
they O
're O
doing O

his O
parents O
are O
n't O
even O
living O
on O
the O
kibbutz O
anymore O
because O
he O
's O
a O
professor O
of O
something O
or O
other O
in O
I O
do O
n't O
know O
China S-GPE
or O
somewhere O

Singapore S-GPE

I O
do O
n't O
know O
where O

anyway O
so O
that O
was O
really O
weird O

like O
when O
she O
got O
engaged O
it O
was O
a O
little O
hard O
for O
Rachel S-PERSON
because O
he O
's O
not O
religious O
and O
everyone O
was O
really O
upset O

gosh O
you O
would O
think O
at O
least O
in O
Israel S-GPE
you O
would O
get O
what O
you O
want O

No O

but O
not O
only O
that O

what O

this O
kid O
just O
left O
the O
kibbutz O
at O
eighteen S-DATE

and O
now O
at O
nineteen S-DATE
he O
's O
coming O

&uh O
you O
know O
like O

He O
also O
had O
a O
lot O
of O
different O
boyfriends O
during O
her O
lifetime O

anyway O
to O
make O
a O
long O
story O
short O
she O
had O
her O
wedding O
also O

but O
hers O
we O
did O
like O
%um O
a O
buffet O

so O
I O
was O
really O
nervous O
about O
that O
because O
when O
did O
we O
ever O
do O
a O
buffet O

so O
we O
rented O
the O
tables O
and O
chairs O
again O

and O
we O
rented O
all O
the O
beautiful O
dishes O

yeah O

But O
we O
set O
up O
the O
buffet O

we O
bought O
like O
these O
really O
neat O

you O
know O
like O
they O
're O

Well O
we O
saved O
them O
because O
you O
can O
wash O
them O

they O
're O
made O
out O
of O
plastic O

but O
they O
look O
like O
silver O
trays O

uh-huh O

yeah O

So O
we O
bought O
all O
different O
shapes O
and O
sizes O

and O
we O
put O
out O
the O
salads O
and O
the O
meats O
and O
all O
different O
kinds O
that O

we O
had O
%um O
little O
cocktail O
hot O
dogs O

and O
we O
had O
chicken O
legs O

and O
we O
had O
schnitzels O

oh O
and O
they O
made O
a O
beautiful O
basket O
with O
breads O
you O
know O
everything O
falling O
out O
on O
the O
table O

you O
know O
those O
kind O
of O
things O

no O

wow O

No O

it O
was O
beautiful O

it O
also O
came O
out O
really O
nice O

the O
only O
thing O

you O
guys O
must O
feel O
so O
old O
that O
you O
have O
married O
children O
already O

yeah O

we O
do O
feel O
old O

and O
it O
was O
beautiful O

Ramona S-PERSON
's O
was O
nicer O
because O
they O
had O
a O
great O
band O
and O
everybody O
was O
that O

you O
know O
like O
usually O
in O
a O
wedding O
there O
's O
no O
room O
to O
dance O

but O
the O
whole O
parking O
lot O
was O
for O
dancing O

and O
on O
the O
grass O
was O
where O
we O
sat O

wow O

uh-huh O

so O
it O
was O
like O
as O
if O
you O
would O
've O
seen O
you O
know O
dance O
festival O
because O
there O
was O
like O
a O
circle O
of O
men O
a O
circle O
of O
girls O
a O
circle O
of O
her O
friends O
a O
circle O
of O
his O
friends O
because O
there O
was O
enough O
room O
the O
kids O
had O
a O
circle O
that O
you O
could O
have O
like O
five O
six O
different O
circles O
all O
over O
the O
place O

oh O
my O
gosh O

it O
was O
beautiful O

and O
Ta'al O
's O

what O
happened O

you O

that O
Rachel S-PERSON

really O
worried O
that O
people O
wo O
n't O

for O
her O
be O
happy O
for O
her O

I O
do O
n't O

why O

that O
was O
ridiculous O
because O
everyone O

but O
her O

got O
stuck O
somewhere O

and O
their O
%um O

So O
some O
people O
got O
really O
you O
know O

just O
they O
did O
n't O
dance O

and O
she O
was O
really O
upset O

I O
said O
Rachel S-PERSON
why O
did O
you O
even O
bother O
paying O
them O

Well O
that O
's O
true O

getting O
this O
really O
great O
group O

and O
even O
if O
we O
would O
've O
known O
they O
were O
stuck O
so O
call O
the O
kibbutz O

we O
would O
've O
sent O
the O
car O
to O
go O
get O
it O

right O

oh O
gosh O

so O

was O
bad O
news O

it O

But O
the O
Taiwan S-GPE
red O

The O

the O

Perhaps O
the B-DATE

was O
a O

one O

for O
the B-ORG

How O
can O
Taiwan S-GPE

Can O
the O

Perhaps O
these O

which O
is O
an O

Chang S-PERSON
explains O

always O

Largely O
due O

his O

Chinese S-NORP
archeology O
attained O
a O
sturdy O
theoretical O
and O
practical O
foundation O
that O
enabled O
it O
to O
emerge O
as O
a O

His O
research O
showed O
that O
the O

civilization O
did O
not O
occur O
exclusively O
in O
the O
area O

it O

Then O

an O

It O

when O

his O

his O

Taiwanese S-NORP
people O

invariably O
wish O

Thanks O

H. B-PERSON

, O
the O
TBAD S-ORG
began O
working O
seriously O
in O
1994 S-DATE
to O
establish O

but O
the O
difficulties O
were O
considerable O

They O
had O
to O
find O
land O

much O
more O
. O

With O
Taiwanese S-NORP
and O
mainland O
authorities O
at O
political O

, O
the O
school O

seeking O

They O
also O
had O
to O
obtain O
the O
cooperation O
of O
the O
authorities O
in O
Taiwan S-GPE

Since O

planning O

run O
the O

they O

Teacher O
seniority O
was O
also O
a O
major O

if O

The O

both O
an B-TIME

and O
many O
of O
the O
Taiwanese S-NORP
in O
Dongguan S-GPE
want O
to O
be O
able O
to O
see O
their O

This O
prompted O
a O
group O

to O
establish O
a O
private O

called O
Little B-ORG

February B-DATE

The O
school O
admits O
children O
from O
kindergarten O

age O
five S-DATE

through O
grade O

of O
elementary O

200 S-CARDINAL
students O

such O
as O
Norman B-PERSON
Hsu I-PERSON

used O

school O
in O
Shenzhen S-GPE

have O
transferred O
in O
from O
the O
mainland O
Chinese S-NORP
public O
school O
system O
. O

Little B-ORG
Oxford E-ORG
is O
very O
similar O
to O
the O
Taiwanese S-NORP
school O
being O
promoted O
by O
the O
TBAD S-ORG
. O

Most O
of O
its O
teaching O
materials O
are O
very O
similar O
to O
those O
used O
in O
Taiwan S-GPE

elementary O
schools O
, O
and O
of O
the O
15 S-CARDINAL
or O
so O
teachers O
there O
, O
three S-CARDINAL
are O
from O
Taiwan S-GPE
. O

The O
big O
difference O
is O
that O
classes O
are O
taught O
in O
both O
Chinese S-LANGUAGE
and O
English S-LANGUAGE
because O
the O
Taiwanese S-NORP
parents O
are O
very O
interested O
in O
seeing O
that O
their O
children O
learn O
English S-LANGUAGE
well O
. O

According O
to O
Huang B-PERSON
Su E-PERSON
, O
executive O
director O
of O
Little B-ORG
Oxford E-ORG
, O
" O
A O
lot O
of O
parents O
keep O
after O
me O
to O
make O
sure O
that O
the O
children O
's O
education O
is O
exactly O
like O
the O
regular O
system O
in O
Taiwan S-GPE
, O
but O
I O
have O
to O
remind O
them O
that O
once O
you O
've O
left O
in O
Taiwan S-GPE
, O
you O
're O
not O
regular O
any O
longer O
. O
" O

According O
to O
Huang S-PERSON
, O
making O
the O
school O
a O
mirror O
image O
of O
those O
in O
Taiwan S-GPE
does O
not O
necessarily O
mean O
that O
you O
are O
running O
a O
good O
school O
. O

The O
key O
is O
to O
provide O
an O
education O
that O
meets O
the O
needs O
of O
the O
students O
. O

In O
addition O
to O
Taiwanese S-NORP

materials O

She O
came O
to O
Dongguan S-GPE
after O
marrying O
a O
Taiwanese S-NORP
expat O
there O
, O
and O
it O
was O
the O
Taiwanese S-NORP
business O

that O
asked O
her O
to O
run O
a O
school O
. O

Little B-ORG

now O

a O
very O
good O
reputation O
in O

In O
fact O

some O
Taiwanese S-NORP
send O
their O

Huang S-PERSON

deeply O

the O

" O

The O
Taiwanese S-NORP
kids O
at O

come O
from O
many O
different O
backgrounds O

Some O
speak O
in O
a O
mixture O
of O
Chinese S-LANGUAGE

English S-LANGUAGE
, O
while O
others O
speak O

look O
just O
like O

Many O

One O

the O

The O

basically O
empty O

the O
roar O
of O
excavators O
fills O
the O
air O
, O
and O
the O
steel O
piles O
have O
already O
been O
driven O
. O

The O
school O

are O
located O
next O

the O
ancient O
Beidi B-WORK_OF_ART

which O

the O

On O
the O

a O
fading O
couplet O
reads O
: O
" O
He O
who O
is O
truly O
dedicated O
to O
his O

become O
a O

He O

no O

The O

must O
have O
taken O
this O
message O
to O

over O
the O
years O
, O
because O
it O
is O
said O
that O
hometown O

from O
Zhongtang S-GPE
often O
took O
the O
top O
spot O
in O
the O
imperial O
examinations O
of O
centuries O
past O

It O
is O
very O
gratifying O
that O
a O
place O
like O
Dongguan S-GPE
, O
with O
its O
abundant O
business O
opportunities O
, O
should O
also O
have O
a O

It O
is O
also O
exciting O
to O
look O

the O

only O
39 B-PERCENT

which O
translates O
to O

As O
a O
result O
, O
he O
must O
take O
a O
moderate O
line O
that O

He O
will O
have O
to O

keep O

As O
for O

, O
" O

It O

not O

Taiwan S-GPE

without O
any O

Are O
the O

really O
prepared O

see O
Hong B-GPE

up O

" O

There O
are O
other O
perspectives O

of O

The O
seminar O
participants O
basically O
fell O
into O
three S-CARDINAL
camps O
on O
future O
prospects O
. O

Some O
were O
highly O
optimistic O
, O
others O
were O
guardedly O
optimistic O
, O
and O
a O
third S-ORDINAL
group O
argued O
that O
the O
crystal O
ball O
has O
gone O
cloudy O
. O

Perhaps O
the O
most O
optimistic O
view O
was O
expressed O
by O
Ruan B-PERSON
Ming E-PERSON
, O
a O
visiting O
professor O
at O
Tamkang B-ORG
University I-ORG

Department B-ORG
of I-ORG
China I-ORG

who O
in O
the O
1980s S-DATE
was O
an O
assistant O
to O
former O
Chinese S-NORP
Communist S-NORP
Secretary O
General O
Hu B-PERSON
Yaobang E-PERSON
. O

Ruan S-PERSON
stated O
that O
Beijing S-GPE
's O
basic O
position O
on O
Taiwan S-GPE
has O
not O
changed O
at O
all O
since O
the O
days O
of O
Deng B-PERSON
Xiaoping E-PERSON
. O

" O
There O
's O
nothing O
new O
in O
what O
they O
're O
saying O
. O
" O

The O
only O
thing O
the O
Chinese S-NORP
Communists S-NORP
are O
saying O
, O
says O
Ruan S-PERSON
, O
is O
that O
they O
will O
attack O
" O
if O
Taiwan S-GPE
makes O
any O
sort O
of O
formal O
move O
toward O
independence O
, O
" O
and O
Taiwan S-GPE
has O
no O
need O
to O
formalize O
anything O
because O
changing O
the O
country O
's O
name O
would O
be O
meaningless O
. O

" O
No O
matter O
what O
you O
call O
yourself O
, O
people O
are O
still O
going O
to O
call O
you O
Taiwan S-GPE
. O

It O
's O
just O
like O
in O
England S-GPE
- O
the O
official O
name O
is O
the B-GPE
United I-GPE
Kingdom I-GPE
of I-GPE
Great I-GPE
Britain I-GPE
and I-GPE
Northern I-GPE
Ireland E-GPE
, O
but O
nobody O
calls O
it O
that O
. O

And O
there O
's O
no O
need O
to O
going O
around O
shouting O
, O
' O
We O
're O
a O
country O
! O
We O
're O
a O
country O
! O

Who O
in O
the O
international O
community O
does O
that O
? O
" O



Pragmatism O
, O
please O

" O
Taiwan S-GPE
needs O
to O
be O
more O
pragmatic O
, O
" O
says O
Ruan S-PERSON
, O
" O
just O
like O
the O
mainland O
. O
" O

They O
made O
a O
lot O
of O
noise O
ahead O
of O
the O
election O
trying O
to O
sway O
votes O
, O
but O
once O
the O
election O
was O
over O
they O
backpedaled O
quickly O
with O
the O
simple O
statement O
, O
" O
We O
'll O
wait O
and O
see O
what O
they O
say O
and O
do O
. O
" O

The O
attitude O
with O
them O
, O
in O
Ruan S-PERSON
's O
view O
, O
is O
very O
pragmatic O
. O

Ruan S-PERSON
is O
optimistic O
about O
cross-strait O
relations O
under O
the O
new O
regime O
, O
and O
states O
, O
" O
Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian E-PERSON
is O
best O
positioned O
to O
improve O
cross-strait O
relations O
. O
" O

He O
likens O
Chen S-PERSON
to O
the O
staunchly O
anti-communist O
Richard B-PERSON
Nixon E-PERSON
, O
who O
was O
able O
to O
normalize O
ties O
with O
the B-NORP
Chinese I-NORP
Communists E-NORP
precisely O
because O
he O
was O
trusted O
by O
the O
American S-NORP
people O
. O

Similarly O
, O
when O
Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian E-PERSON
negotiates O
with O
Beijing S-GPE
, O
no O
one O
will O
worry O
about O
him O
selling O
Taiwan S-GPE
down O
the O
river O
. O

The O

agreed O
strongly O
with O
Ruan S-PERSON

comments O
, O
and O
added O
, O
" O
In O
this O
election O
the O
people O
of O
Taiwan S-GPE
were O
even O
more O
concerned O
about O
domestic O
issues O
than O
they O
were O
about O
cross-strait O
relations O
. O
" O

The O
most O
pressing O
issues O
facing O
the O

are O
education O

Chen S-PERSON

upward O

Virtually O
everyone O
at O
the O

in O

it O
is O
neither O

nor O
necessary O
to O
seek O
a O

to O
the O

that O

He O

there O
has O
been O
no O
fundamental O
change O

he O
listed O
a O

variables O

bear O
close O

The O
first S-ORDINAL
is O
the O

Third S-ORDINAL
, O
Taiwan S-GPE

If O

And O
yes O
, O
once O
again O
, O
it O
is O
true O
that O
the B-NORP
Chinese I-NORP

have O
muted O
their O
rhetoric O
considerably O
. O

Nevertheless O
, O
the O
two S-CARDINAL

view O

suspicion O

If O
the B-NORP

conclude O
that O
Taiwan S-GPE

leadership O
has O
dropped O
its O
insistence O

only O
to O
pursue O
a O
policy O
that O
includes O

Tseng B-PERSON

feels O
that O
Taiwan S-GPE
should O
claim O
the O
high O

by O
holding O
up O
its O
experience O
in O
democratization O
as O
an O
example O
for O
the B-NORP
Chinese I-NORP

Says O
Tseng O
, O
" O
Reunification O
depends O
entirely O
on O
whether O
China S-GPE
can O
democratize O
. O
" O

His O
biggest O
worry O
is O
that O
the O
deep O
gulf O
between O
the O
DPP S-ORG
and O
the O
mainland O
authorities O
could O
cause O
them O
to O
misread O

He O
stressed O
that O
there O
are O
both O

the O

herself O

argued O
that O
the O
protest O
revealed O
an O
ethnic O
fault O
line O
in O
Taiwanese S-NORP
society O

It O
was O
a O
venting O
of O
mass O
frustration O
on O
the O
part O
of O
one O

group O
, O
said O
Ping S-PERSON
, O
noting O
that O
most O
of O
the O

were O
mainlanders O

This O
group O
feels O
a O
loss O
of O
status O
, O
for O
during O
the O
many O
decades O
of O
KMT S-ORG
rule O
they O
have O
always O
thought O
of O
themselves O
as O
a O
privileged O
" O

" O
in O
Taiwan S-GPE
even O
though O
in O
fact O
they O
are O
a O
minority O

They O
do O
not O
identify O
with O
Taiwan S-GPE
as O
their O
home O

and O
they O
have O
an O
unconscious O
feeling O
of O
superiority O
vis O

a O
- O
vis O
the O
local O
majority O

In O
some O
ways O
the O
election O
has O
forced O
them O
to O
realize O
that O
they O
truly O
are O
a O

This O
development O
should O
help O
to O
bring O
about O
long O

ethnic O
harmony O
in O
Taiwan S-GPE
. O

The O
participants O
generally O
felt O
that O
the O
election O
was O
a O
victory O
for O
democracy O
. O

On O
the O
domestic O
front O
, O
the O
victory O
of O
Chen B-PERSON

showed O
that O
people O
want O
more O

a O
more O

In O

Chen S-PERSON

the O

Yet O
, O
he O
may O
not O
know O
about O
Pali S-GPE

real O
heyday O
, O
long O
in O
the O
past O

The O
days O
of O
the O
sailing O
ships O

Pali S-GPE
was O
originally O
called O
Palifen S-GPE
, O
a O
transliteration O
of O
the O
place O
name O
used O
by O
the O
Ketagalan S-NORP
indigenous O
people O
. O

Located O
on O
the O
northwest O
corner O
of O
Taiwan S-GPE
, O
Pali S-GPE
faces O
the B-LOC
Taiwan I-LOC
Strait E-LOC
to O
the O
northwest O
, O
rests O
against O
Mt. B-LOC
Kuanyin E-LOC
to O
the O
southeast O
, O
and O
looks O
across O
the O
river O
toward O
Tanshui S-GPE
to O
the O
northeast O
. O

Though O
it O
does O
n't O
have O
much O
of O
a O
hinterland O
, O
its O
geographic O
location O
has O
proved O
historically O
important O
, O
as O
one O
can O
see O
from O
the O
prehistoric O
cultures O
unearthed O
at O

Later O
, O
when O
Han B-NORP
Chinese E-NORP
began O
trickling O
across O
to O
Taiwan S-GPE
, O
they O
mainly O
settled O
along O
rivers O
. O

Because O
Pali S-GPE
is O
relatively O
close O
to O
the O
mainland O
and O
sits O
at O
the O
mouth O
of O
a O
river O
, O
despite O
the O
fact O
that O
it O
does O
not O
have O
a O
natural O
harbor O
, O
in O
1757 S-DATE
the O
Qing S-NORP
court O
designated O
it O
to O
be O
one O
of O
Taiwan S-GPE
's O
small O
number O
of O
official O
ports O
for O
maritime O
transport O
with O
the O
mainland O
. O

Thus O
began O
an O
era O
in O
which O
great O
ships O
sailed O
in O
and O
out O
of O
Pali S-GPE
. O

However O
, O
as O
a O
result O
of O
silting O
and O
a O
destructive O
typhoon O
that O
struck O
in O
1796 S-DATE
, O
Pali S-GPE
began O
to O
give O
way O
in O
importance O
to O
Tanshui S-GPE
, O
located O
just O
across O
the O
river O
. O

Once O
mainly O
dependent O
on O
fishing O
, O
Pali S-GPE
increasingly O
came O
to O
rely O
on O
farming O
. O

But O
the O
hilly O
terrain O
and O
strong O
winds O
meant O
that O
there O
was O
little O
good O
land O
. O

While O
the O
hardy O
people O
of O
Pali S-GPE
barely O
kept O
their O
stomachs O
filled O
, O
their O
children O
and O
grandchildren O
left O
in O
search O
of O
a O
better O
life O
. O

Neither O
the O
Japanese S-NORP
occupation O
-LRB- O
which O
began O
in O
1895 S-DATE
-RRB- O
nor O
the O
return O
to O
Chinese S-NORP
rule O
-LRB- O
in O
1945 S-DATE
-RRB- O
brought O
much O
joy O
or O
change O
to O
this O
rural O

But O
in O
the B-DATE
1970s E-DATE
, O
urban O
planning O
came O
to O
Pali S-GPE
. O

It O
proved O
to O
be O
the O
prelude O
to O
a O
symphony O
-LRB- O
or O
perhaps O
cacophony O
-RRB- O
of O
transformation O
. O



Changing O
the O
rhythm O
of O
Pali S-GPE
life O

During O
the O
height O
of O
real O

speculation O
and O
soaring O
land O

in O
Taipei S-GPE

Also O
, O
to O
try O

reduce O
the O
outflow O
of O
population O
from O
Pali S-GPE
and O
to O
get O
the O
stagnant O
local O

moving O
, O
the O
government O
decided O
to O
link O
this O
formerly O
isolated O
village O
to O
the O
outside O

. O

What O
had O
been O
Chungshan B-FAC

was O
turned O
into O

, O
and O
the O
opening O

the B-FAC
Kuantu I-FAC

to O

linked O
Pali S-GPE
directly O
to O
the O
busy O
Taipei S-GPE
districts O
of O
Shilin S-GPE
and O
Peitou S-GPE
. O

Gifted O
with O
a O
lovely O
setting O
between O
the O
mountains O
and O
the O
sea O
, O
Pali S-GPE
began O
to O
dream O
of O
a O
tourism O
boom O
. O

But O
fortune O
had O
other O
things O
in O
store O
. O

In O
order O
to O
pave O
the O
way O
for O
the O
construction O
of O
a O
water O
treatment O
facility O
on O
the O
northeast O
edge O
of O
Pali S-GPE
, O
the O
plan O
to O
develop O
tourism O
in O
Pali S-GPE
was O
scrapped O
overnight O
. O

The O
government O
, O
applying O
urban O
planning O
principles O
, O
zoned O
the O
area O
for O
residential O
and O
industrial O
use O
, O
in O
order O
to O
create O
a O
construction O
site O
for O
the O
facility O
. O

Then O
in O
1987 S-DATE
came O
the O
program O
to O
bring O
gravel O
from O
eastern O
to O
western O
Taiwan S-GPE
for O
construction O
purposes O
, O
and O
a O
harbor O
was O
built O
on O
the O
Pali S-GPE
coast O
for O
the O
convenience O
of O
gravel O
transporters O
. O

In O
accordance O
with O
the O
urban O
plan O
, O
new O
streets O
were O
cut O
this O
way O
and O
that O
through O

, O
and O
high O

rise O

sprang O
up O
along O
the O

these O

. O

The O
sounds O
of O

at O

resounded O
even O
from O
the O
black O

beaches O
. O

In O
1997 S-DATE
, O
the O
Hsiachuotzu S-GPE
garbage O
landfill O
formally O
opened O
, O
and O
it O
became O
common O
to O

garbage O
trucks O
winding O
through O
the O
streets O
of O
Pali S-GPE

This O
rural O

was O
made O
responsible O
for O
storing O
the O
garbage O
from O
several O

It O
is O
only O

that O
the O

the O

The O

President O
Chen S-PERSON
's O
trip O
yielded O
many O
positive O
results O
and O
generated O
a O
lot O
of O
very O
favorable O
media O
coverage O
, O
but O
it O
was O
not O
problem O
- O
free O
. O

First S-ORDINAL
, O
as O
the O
president O
was O
preparing O
to O
depart O
Taiwan S-GPE
, O
the O
Nicaraguan S-NORP
foreign O
minister O
publicly O
called O
upon O
the O
ROC S-GPE
to O
make O
good O
on O
the O
previous O
administration O
's O
promise O
of O
US$ B-MONEY
100 I-MONEY
million E-MONEY
in O
assistance O
. O

This O
remark O
sparked O
controversy O
in O
Taiwan S-GPE
, O
where O
some O
accused O
the O
new O
government O
of O
pursuing O
the O
same O
" O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
" O
practiced O
by O
its O
predecessor O
. O

Chen B-PERSON
Shui I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
bian E-PERSON
responded O
that O
while O
the O
new O
administration O
has O
not O
made O
plans O
for O
any O
new O
promises O
of O
foreign O
aid O
, O
neither O
will O
it O
fail O
to O
honor O
the O
promises O
made O
by O
its O
predecessor O
. O

Foreign O
Minister O
Tien B-PERSON
Hung I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
mao E-PERSON
stated O
that O
the O
purpose O
of O
Chen S-PERSON
's O
trip O
was O
to O
consolidate O
Taiwan S-GPE
's O
diplomatic O
ties O
, O
and O
to O
strengthen O
friendships O
by O
building O
upon O
the O
existing O
foundation O
. O

Tien S-PERSON
stressed O
that O
the O
president O
would O
not O
sign O
any O
new O
foreign O
aid O
agreements O
. O

President O
Chen S-PERSON
received O
a O
very O
warm O
welcome O
in O
Nicaragua S-GPE
, O
but O
the O
local O
press O
still O
mentioned O
" O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
" O
in O
reporting O
on O
the O
visit O
. O

The O
ROC S-GPE
's O
ambassador O
to O
Nicaragua S-GPE
, O
Antonio B-PERSON
Tsai E-PERSON
, O
bluntly O
argued O
in O
a O
briefing O
with O
Chen S-PERSON
that O
Taiwan S-GPE
's O
foreign O
assistance O
to O
Nicaragua S-GPE
was O
being O
misused O
. O

According O
to O
Tsai S-PERSON
, O
the O
assistance O
has O
been O
used O
to O
build O
a O
presidential O
palace O
and O
a O
new O
headquarters O
for O
the B-ORG
Ministry I-ORG
of I-ORG
Foreign I-ORG
Affairs E-ORG
. O

Opposition O
politicians O
charge O
that O
the O
aid O
has O
done O
nothing O
for O
everyday O
people O
, O
and O
Western S-NORP
nations O
have O
also O
been O
critical O
. O

A O
second S-ORDINAL
problem O
connected O
with O
the O
trip O
was O
the O
question O
of O
who O
would O
act O
in O
the O
president O
's O
stead O
while O
he O
was O
out O
of O
the O
country O
. O

Concern O
over O
this O
issue O
prompted O
President O
Chen S-PERSON
to O
state O
before O
his O
departure O
that O
he O
would O
remain O
commander O
- O
in O
- O
chief O
of O
the O
military O
forces O
, O
and O
that O
he O
would O
maintain O
hot O
lines O
to O
every O
cabinet O
- O
level O
agency O
. O

The O
president O
said O
that O
there O
was O
no O
need O
for O
an O
acting O
president O
because O
he O
had O
taken O
painstaking O
precautions O
to O
ensure O
domestic O
political O
stability O
during O
his O
absence O
. O



So O
is O
Taiwan S-GPE
's O
diplomacy O
a O
way O
of O
giving O
back O
to O
the O
international O
community O
? O

Or O
is O
it O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
? O

Ambassador O
- O
without O
- O
portfolio O
Lu B-PERSON
Yi I-PERSON
- I-PERSON
cheng E-PERSON
wrote O
an O
article O
in O
which O
he O
argued O
that O
foreign O
aid O
has O
always O
been O
universally O
recognized O
as O
a O
regular O
tool O
of O
diplomacy O
as O
well O
as O
a O
humanitarian O
necessity O
, O
and O
there O
is O
no O
reason O
why O
Taiwan S-GPE
should O
have O
to O
steer O
clear O
of O
it O
. O

He O
pointed O
out O
that O
the O
world O
's O
developed O
nations O
spend O
an O
average O
of O
0.24 B-PERCENT
% E-PERCENT
of O
GNP O
on O
foreign O
aid O
, O
as O
opposed O
to O
0.17 B-PERCENT
% E-PERCENT
in O
Taiwan S-GPE
's O
case O
. O

In O
view O
of O
Taiwan S-GPE
's O
economic O
strength O
, O
argued O
Lu S-PERSON
, O
our O
foreign O
aid O
expenditures O
need O
not O
be O
reduced O
; O
in O
fact O
, O
they O
should O
even O
be O
raised O
somewhat O
. O

The O
ROC S-GPE
has O
been O
criticized O
a O
lot O
in O
recent O
years O
for O
pursuing O
checkbook O
diplomacy O
, O
so O
there O
was O
no O
surprise O
when O
this O
issue O
cropped O
up O
in O
connection O
with O
the O
president O
's O
trip O
. O

The O
question O
of O
an O
acting O
president O
, O
however O
, O
has O
never O
before O
been O
a O
matter O
of O
concern O
. O

This O
situation O
is O
to O
some O
degree O
a O
reflection O
of O
the O
fact O
that O
the O
public O
still O
has O
doubts O
about O
the O
new O
administration O
's O
ability O
to O
govern O
. O

This O
is O
an O
important O
point O
that O
is O
worth O
keeping O
in O
mind O
. O
